The League of Nations was therefore established after the war, partly because of American initiatives. This turned out to be rather fruitless, as many superpowers were not members. The organisation was unable to prevent numerous wars in during the years between the two world wars, or the conflicts that led up to the Second World War. The first notions of a “United Nations” were put forward by American president Franklin D. Roosevelt. This was already the official title in 1942 for the allied powers who were fighting alongside each other during the Second World War.<br />When the war ended a number of conferences were held, the largest and most important of these being the 1945 San Francisco conference, which was attended by delegations from 50 different countries to draw up the UN Charter. The 111 articles of this charter are the foundation of the United Nations, serving as a kind of constitution. The charter describes the various main institutions of the UN, their role within the UN and globally, where decisions are made and the role of regional institutions within the UN. It also states how conflicts can be resolved, which has been crucial to more recent UN missions.<br />The charter was undersigned by Denmark and 49 other nations on 26 June 1945, Poland soon following , before being ratified by the participating nations. Everything was finally in place on 24 October. With 51 participating member states, the United Nations was now the largest international organisation in the world. Its purpose then, as it is today, was to end war and to promote peace, justice and a better way of life for all humanity.</p>"

This is where budgets are adopted, new members accepted and the General Secretary elected. Since the Uniting for Peace resolution was adopted in 1950, the General Assembly has been authorised to deploy peacekeeping forces after an emergency meeting, if the Security Council is unable to act because one or more of its members has exercised veto. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding, however, and it is up to member states whether they wish to abide by them.<br /><em>The Security Council</em> is comprised of five permanent members and ten alternating members selected by the General Assembly. The Security Council is the only organ that is able to adopt legally binding resolutions. According to Chapter VII of the Charter, the Security Council is tasked with evaluating and condemning threats to and violations of international peace. It is therefore the Security Council that is competent, through the adoption of resolutions, to mandate sanctions or international interventions in conflicts and therefore establish UN observation missions and operations. <br /><em>The Secretariat</em> is led by the General Secretary and is responsible for the UN’s administration, servicing the other organs and preparing the budget before it is sent to the General Assembly for a vote on its adoption. It is also responsible for planning and preparing conferences and drafting studies and reports for the agenda, as well as possible options for action.<br /><em>The Economic and Social Council</em>, or ECOSOC in short, has 54 members selected by the General Assembly. The main purpose of this council is to promote the development of economic and social conditions through international partnerships.<br /><em>The Trusteeship Council</em> was established in 1945 by the UN Charter, under Chapter XIII, to provide international supervision for 11 Trust Territories that had been placed under the administration of seven Member States, and ensure that adequate steps were taken to prepare the Territories for self-government and independence. By 1994, all Trust Territories had attained self-government or independence. The Trusteeship Council suspended operation on 1 November 1994.<br /><em>The International Court of Justice</em>, or ICJ, is the UN’s judiciary. Its 15 members are also selected by the General Assembly. Its purpose is to resolve conflicts through legal channels. Only states are able to present cases to the ICJ. The UN’s own organs are, however, entitled to ask for legal evaluations.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>THE RIGHT OF VETO<br />The 15 members of the UN Security Council are not equal. The five permanent members are the victorious powers of the Second World War: the USA, United Kingdom, France, China and the Soviet Union. When the Soviet Union disintegrated its place went to Russia. To persuade these powerful nations to accept the role of the UN and not stay outside it, as happened with the League of Nations after the First World War, they were given a special role within the organisation. The five permanent members therefore have the right to veto within the Security Council. Each resolution requires not only a majority, but the agreement of all five powers, or abstention. There have been many situations where it has been difficult for the UN to take action, as the five permanent members often have conflicting interests. It was difficult to reach agreement during the Cold War because of rivalry between the Soviet Union and USA. Despite optimism that we had entered a new era of collaboration during the 1990s this has again been a problem in recent years, including when an intervention in the civil war in Syria was made impossible because of the Russian veto. Although the Uniting for Peace resolution was intended to be a solution to such occurrences, it has seldom been applied with any effect, as the veto of the five permanent members often represents powerful interests.<br />The five permanent members no longer represent a broad cross section of the world as it is today. The Security Council’s structure was designed in 1945, when it made better sense as large parts of the world were French and British colonies. Nowadays it seems strange to many that France and, more recently Britain and, in some regards, Russia have a seat at the table, while an enormous country like India does not have representation. It has also been criticised that Africa, South America or the Arabic World are not represented among the permanent members of the Security Council. There have therefore been multiple attempts to reform the Security Council, by proposing additional permanent members or by abolishing the right to veto, but these have come to no fruition.</p>"

Some of the larger ones include the <em>World Health Organisation</em> (or <em>WHO</em> in short) and the UN <em>Food and Agriculture Organization</em> (<em>FAO</em>), which are both examples of practically-oriented organisations that combat disease and famine. Others, such as UNESCO work to promote culture, education and knowledge. Others are even older than the UN. The <em>International Labour Organization</em> <em>(ILO)</em> was founded as part of the League of Nations in 1919, but has been absorbed into the UN. The oldest is the I<em>nternational Telecommunications Union (ITU</em>), that was founded in 1865, but is now a UN agency.<br />The U<em>N Refugee Agency (UNHCR)</em> is one of the larger organisations that is most frequently in contact with the Danish Emergency Management Agency when it is deployed on behalf of the UN. Examples of close collaborations with the UNHCR include AFOR (deployed in Albania during the refugee crisis that arose from the conflict in Kosovo) and UNPROFOR (deployed in the former Yugoslavia). <br />Humanitarian aspects are important areas in which the UN takes action during all conflicts and catastrophes. The <em>United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)</em> was set up to coordinate the numerous initiatives. During all its years of operation Denmark has actively participated in these with the various deployments of the Danish Emergency Management Agency.<br />There are also various organisations that are not directly part of the UN but that were set up as a result of UN resolutions or conventions that were negotiated within the UN. The <em>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</em> is the most famous example of such an organisation, typically acting together with the UN and reporting to the General Assembly annually. The same applies to the <em>Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW)</em>, on whose advice the Security Council adopted resolutions that led to the Danish commanded RECLIB and RECSYR operations.</p>"

The 51 founder members have been joined by another 142 nations, making a total of 193 member states. Two more states/areas have observer status. Many of the “new” members were colonies that gained their independence during the decades that followed the Second World War. This was not always an easy process and UN blue-helmets were seen in many parts of the world as former colonies became independent nations. UNMOGIP was set up when India declared independence from the United Kingdom and split into India and Pakistan. In 1960 the fighting that followed independence in the Congo led to a major UN operation known as ONUC.<br />One of the first challenges to be faced was the division of Palestine when the British colonial power decided to pull out of the region. The UN attempted a division plan but this was never implemented. The conflicts that followed led to the UN’s most extensive and longest duration observation mission, UNTSO, which has been followed by numerous others over the years.<br />The Cold War between the USA and the Soviet Union began soon after the UN was founded, both nations having veto rights as part of the Security Council. The UN was therefore unable to intervene in a long list of conflicts, as one side or the other used their right of veto. When the Communist Party was the victor of the civil war in China, 20 years would pass before the People’s Republic of China was given a seat on the Security Council to replace the Republic of China, which ruled only over Taiwan and was far from being the superpower that is now represented on the Security Council. This situation led to the communist Soviet Union boycotting the Security Council in support of China. This would come back and bite the Soviet Union in the tail. When the Korean War broke out in 1950, the Soviet Union was unable (because of its boycott) to veto a UN force that fought on the side of South Korea. <br />The Korean War is what led to the adoption of the Uniting for Peace (UFP) resolution by the General Assembly. If the Security Council has been paralysed by the right of veto this resolution allows the convening of an emergency meeting of the General Assembly to mandate peacekeeping operations. During the Suez crisis in 1956 in which France and the United Kingdom used their right of veto, the General Assembly convened and decided to deploy its first actual peacekeeping force, in the form of UNEF. It is seldom that the UFP procedure is used, however, as there is normally insufficient manpower and political will to take action if the powerful nations who are permanent members of the Security Council are in disagreement about how to proceed.<br />The end of the Cold War gave the UN better options. It was with a UN mandate that Operation Desert Storm was able to drive Iraq out of Kuwait during the first Gulf War and that UNIKOM was created to monitor the peace that followed. The UN would now face new types of conflict, however. There would seldom be wars between actual nations, like those that the UN was created to prevent. Instead, challenges would come from civil wars and nations that collapsed within their own borders.<br />The former Yugoslavia was where the UN would face one of its biggest crises, as UNPROFOR was unable to secure and bring about peace using the so-called “safe zones” that had been set up during the war. The massacre at Srebrenica and the siege and shelling of Sarajevo are examples of conflicts that the UN was unable to solve. When peace did eventually lie on the horizon, the UN had an important role to play in bringing stability to the region, including in the form of UNTAES and UNPREDEP.</p>\n<p>It seems likely in the new millenium, however, that a new cold war will paralyse the Security Council once again. Despite an effective intervention in Libya in the form of Operation Unified Protector, the Arabian Spring and the conflicts that followed it have revealed differing approaches by Russia and the West. The conflicts in Syria and the Ukraine are two examples of how the right of veto has prevented the UN from bringing about effective resolutions. Nevertheless, UN operations such as RECSYR and RECLIB have been essential to reducing the use of chemical weapons in ongoing conflicts.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>MISSION TYPES<br />When personnel from Danish Defence, the Danish Police and the Danish Emergency Management Agency are sent out to serve under the UN it can be on various types of missions. The four types listed here often overlap or are linked in various ways. What they all share in common is that the UN has no military or police of its own that it can deploy. It must instead ask member states to contribute by providing the necessary personnel.<br /><em>Observer or monitoring missions</em> typically involve a smaller team of officers or police personnel, who can be deployed with light armaments in areas where there are existing or prior conflicts, or where there is a risk that conflict will break out. In other words, these personnel are the UN’s eyes and ears on the ground. As such, they are not mandated to prevent a conflict, only to observe and report about what is going on. UNSMIS was one such recent observer mission to which Denmark has contributed recently, where the team was charged with monitoring a ceasefire that had been negotiated by the UN special envoy.<br /><em>Peacekeeping missions</em> often work closely alongside observer missions and it is not always possible to distinguish the boundaries between where one starts and the other ends. These are typically Security Council initiatives that involve large military units who may not, as a general rule, use force for purposes other than self-defence. In an ideal world they are peacekeepers, because a ceasefire or peace agreement has been negotiated. The purpose of missions of this type is to keep the combatants apart, to implement the return of occupied areas or to patrol demilitarised zones along a border. Their operation is normally only with the clear acceptance of both conflicted parties. It is not the intention that they should force a peace. UNEF was the first peacekeeping mission and was also the first in which Denmark deployed personnel to a mission of this type.<br /><em>Peace enforcing missions</em> are more clearly differentiated from observer and peacekeeping missions, as they can only be initiated by the Security Council, have heavier armaments and do not necessarily require the consent of the parties to the conflict. By contrast, the purpose of peacebringing missions is to force a ceasefire or peace agreement in scenarios where one or more parties is unwilling to accept a peace that is based on the expectations of the international community. Operations Faraway and Desert Storm were peacebringing missions, as they involved maintaining an embargo and actual military action aimed at ending the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, using force if necessary.<br /><em>Humanitarian missions</em> cover widely diverse concepts, which can be closely affiliated to the above types of mission, or completely isolated from them. Peacekeeping and peacebringing missions often have humanitarian traits, as troops participating in the mission are also involved in the distribution and securing of emergency aid, or the protection of civilians against attack. Some missions are entirely humanitarian, for example where there are earthquakes, famines or other disaster. Here, the presence has no decidedly military purpose and serves only to provide emergency aid, even though a military presence may be necessary for security reasons. <br />There have also been humanitarian interventions where the UN has intervened in a conflict to protect a civilian population, often against the will of the sitting government. One such example was Operation Unified Protector in Libya. <br />Responsibility to Protect is the UN tenet behind its humanitarian interventions in which military force is used to prevent a state from commiting crimes against humanity.</p>"

The 1970s were therefore characterised as a period of de-escalation between the two superpowers that became known as the détente (which is French for “easing of tension”). A number of treaties were signed during the détente and the two sides began to cooperate, including on setting up a Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in 1973. The conference was intended to be a multi-national diplomatic forum that would serve as the backdrop for increased dialogue between the European states, the USA and Canada. The conference meetings culminated in the drafting of the Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Accords. This document was signed in 1975 by the USA, Canada, the Soviet Union and all European states except Albania and Andorra.<br />Its provisions can be divided in to three “baskets”. Basket 1 concerns political and military relationships and the establishment of mutual security and confidence, including respect for each state’s sovereignty and borders. Basket 2 concerns economic and environmental cooperation. Basket 3 concerns initiatives to do with cultural and technological exchange and respect for universal human rights.<br />The Helsinki Accords were an agreement on policy. The provisions they contained were therefore far more wide-reaching than would otherwise have been possible at that point in time. Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev considered the accords to be a political victory, consolidating the territories the Soviet Union had acquired during the Second World War. The accords became considered, however, as legitimisation for the various dissident movements and human rights organisations that began to sprout in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in their wake. <br />When the Soviet Union and Communist Eastern European régimes collapsed, it was decided that CSCE's role would be extended, making it an institution that would serve to integrate the newly-independent states within the context of Western Europe. The Charter for a New Europe (also known as the Charter of Paris) was signed in 1990. In 1995 CSCE was renamed the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).<br />With 57 members, OSCE is now the largest international security organisation in the world. The Helsinki Accords continue as the basis for OSCE focus areas, with their political/military, environmental and economic/environmental aspects.</p>"

Denmark has been an active participant in CSCE/OSCE for many years, not least with regard to its work towards increased respect for human rights. A meeting on human rights was held in Copenhagen in 1990 and Denmark held the position of OSCE chair in 1997.</p>"

The summits contribute towards establishing a common political direction for OSCE to follow in future.

This is comprised of ambassadors from OSCE member states, who meet on a weekly basis to discuss actualities.<br />In addition to the decision-making bodies, OSCE also has a number of administrative institutions These include the <em>Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR)</em> in Warsaw, the <em>High Commissioner on National Minorities (HCNM)</em> in the Hague and the <em>Representative on Freedom of the Media</em> in Vienna.<br />ODIHR’s task is to support member states through democratisation processes and to promote respect for human rights, including by assisting in and monitoring elections in member states. <br />HCNM’s task is to react to and report on ethnic tensions and minority population issues in member states before they develop further. If a member state is unable to live up to its international obligations, the High Commissioner will assist by providing analyses, recommendations and guidelines.<br />The work of the Representative on Freedom of the Media can be divided into two areas:<br />1) Observation of media developments in member states and<br />2) Reporting on areas where there is room for criticism.<br />One of the representative’s tasks is to assist states in their fulfilment of obligations with regard to freedom of speech and freedom of the media. <br />Finally, there is a <em>Parliamentary Assembly,</em> comprised of MPs from OSCE member states, which meets twice annually. The assembly functions as a forum for parliamentary diplomacy and debate, leading election observation missions and as a stakeholder towards increasing international cooperations to maintain political, security, economic, environmental and human rights obligations. The secretariat of the Parliamentary Assembly is in Copenhagen.</p>"

Field missions include observing elections, advice, rebuilding, observer/ recording missions in wartime and crisis management. <br />OSCE work areas can be divided into three dimensions: 1)political/military, 2)environmental/economic and 3)humanitarian.<br />For the political/military dimension the OSCE works in areas such as ensuring increased openness and transparency among its member states. This includes areas such as arms control and de-escalation, reforms to the various member states’ security sectors, the prevention of conflict, as well as crisis management, police training, defeating terrorism and border controls. <br />With regard to the environmental/economic dimension, OSCE supports member states in good government and the maintenance of basic principles of law and order, increased focus on the environment, stamping out corruption and the management of hazardous waste. OSCE also facilitates increased economic collaborations, safe energy and sustainable development.<br />Finally, for the humanitarian dimension, all members agree that sustainable European security cannot be achieved without respect for human rights and the function of democratic institutions. OSCE therefore assists member states in areas such as strengthening their democratic institutions, conducting elections that are legitimate, transparent and democratic, and the promotion of equality, freedom of the media, property rights, the rights of minorities and law and order.</p>"

As a general rule, any deployment must be based on a UN mandate. In areas where there is a risk of violent clashes, missions involve: the prevention of actual hostilities, the prevention of conflict, the documentation of actual acts of war and breaches to agreements, as well as the negotiation of peaceful solutions. One example of this is when OSCE appointed a Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) with regard to the Ukraine conflict. Its task was to observe and report on the situation and to promote dialogue between the opposing sides. Denmark has provided about 20 observers to OSCE SMM. Another example was the mission to Moldova, where OSCE is leading negotiations towards a peaceful resolution between Moldova and the separatist Transnistria region. <br />Many OSCE missions also provide assistance in rebuilding countries after conflicts. These assignments involve assuring peaceful, stable development through measures to promote democracy and support for free and legitimate elections. Examples of how this is achieved include: advice, expert support and partnership projects with the host countries themselves. Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina were examples of such missions, where Danish police officers have participated on multiple occasions to support rebuilding and other assistance. The Danish Police have assisted in the introduction of democracy to Albania and Montenegro, supported the rebuilding of East Slavonia in Croatia and trained local police officers in Macedonia. Danish Defence and the Danish Police have also deployed observers to the Ukraine.<br />OSCE has occasionally organised multi-national peacekeeping operations, mandated by the UN Security Council. One example of this was Operation ALBA in Albania in 1997, which was deployed to bring peace to the country after unrest that was the result of economic collapse. Danish Defence took part in this operation.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>BACKGROUND<br />In 1951 Belgium, France, West Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands formed the European Coal and Steel Community, followed in 1957 by their formation of the European Economic Community. At its heart lay a desire for partnership and economic integration between its member states, intended to serve as the basis for a stable, wealthy and peaceful Europe. Two terrible wars in Europe had been a lesson. Together with the European Atomic Energy Community of 1957, the three organisations merged in 1967 as a supra-national organisation called the European Community (EC), which aimed for increased economic, political and legal integration in Europe. The first expansion of the European Community was in 1973, when Denmark, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom joined.<br />In the 1993 Maastricht Treaty, 13 EC members formed the European Union (EU), in which the EC was the first of three political “pillars”. The two other “pillars” were a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP)<br />and a partnership on policing and criminal law. <br />The goal of the EU is to promote peace and democratic liberal values, as well as the welfare of its populations. The Maastricht Treaty included the creation of a joint economic and monetary union, the purpose of which was to secure the inner market among its member states.<br />The formation of the EU was thus the first time that foreign affairs and security policies became part of the process of European integration, despite the fact that it had already been a subtext of the original ideas, in which partnership, mutual trade and integration were to help to prevent wars and other hostilities. Because Denmark had opted out of the defence provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, it does not take part in decisions or actions that impact EU defence and security policy. Furthermore, Denmark no longer takes part in military missions, but has been a strong contributor to EU civilian missions. The Danish EU opt-outs therefore have no impact on Denmark’s competence or willingness to participate in EU civilian and police missions. Denmark has thus prioritised its alliance with NATO as its main guarantor of defence and security.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>INITIATIVES<br />The development of an independent security policy was not relevant during the Cold War, during which the NATO alliance was the most important organism with regard to EU member states’ security policies. When the EU was formed in 1993, several of its members wanted to develop an independent security policy, with a view to minimising the EU’s dependence on the USA and strengthening Europe. With the 1997 <em>Amsterdam Treaty</em>, the EU took a further step towards an actual external security policy that would include humanitarian and rescue duties, peacekeeping missions, military resources in crisis management and peaceenforcing. <br />As stipulated in the Amsterdam Treaty, the <em>European Security and Defence Policy (ESFP</em>) was launched in 1999 and was intended to serve as the framework for the development of capacities to permit the independent management of security-related objectives. The development of a <em>European Rapid Reaction Force</em> was part of this policy. It was in accordance with ESFP that EU Battlegroups were created, comprised of 18 multi-national battalions, each comprised of 1,500-2,000 soldiers. These units report to the Council of the EU and must be able to deploy within 5-10 days after a unanimous decision of the Council. All EU states except Denmark and Malta contribute to EU Battlegroups. A number of non-EU states also take part, including two NATO states (Norway and Turkey) and the Ukraine, Macedonia and Serbia. Although these units have been organised since 2007 they have never been deployed at full strength because of a lack of political decision-making and finance. The most recent developments in the EU have led to a number of questions being asked about the operation and composition of these units.<br />One area that in particular has led to tensions about the EU’s military capacities has been the relationship with NATO and how dependent on the NATO alliance ESFP should be. The nations only have one set of reserves at their disposal and very few countries have earmarked units for deployment to a specific organisation. EU crisis management initiatives are often also impaired by the requirement for there to be agreement in the EU Council, where member states’ foreign affairs and security policies have not always been led by a common viewpoint and interest in the desire for a joint course. Furthermore, the military operations are financed by and receive contributions from the individual member states on an individual basis. This means that missions are relatively small-scale, which has led to the EU’s international initiatives often being characterised as lacking in ambition. <br />Since its beginnings, ESFP has therefore moved away from grand visions of a joint EU defence and more towards civilian crisis management initiatives. This includes initiatives to build capacity through missions that are more civilian in nature, focusing on areas such as policing, public administration, observation, the rule of law and the protection of civilians in conflict zones. <br />In 2000 the <em>Committee for Civilian Aspects of Crisis Management</em> was appointed as an advisory body to relevant ESFP organs about civilian dimensions, including the planning of new missions and the development of strategies for civilian crisis management and civilian capacities.<br />One important step towards an independent civilian dimension was the creation in 2007 of the <em>Civilian Planning and Conduct Capability (CPCC)</em>, CPCC is the operational headquarters for EU civilian missions, for which it performs planning and and operational support. The CPCC’s director is the commander in chief for all missions concerning civilian crisis management and is thus responsible for the strategic planning of EU civilian missions. <br />In 2009 the EU’s pillared structure from 1993 was replaced as part of a major structural reform that was based on the Lisbon Treaty. Amongst other things, the treaty created the post of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, whose task is to coordinate a common approach for the EU on these issues. ESFP changed its name at this point to the Common Security and Defence Policy and was expanded in various areas, including collaboration on defence.</p>"

The agreement also permits the EU to act autonomously from NATO in scenarios in which NATO has declined to intervene. Approval of the use of assets by the EU must be unanimously approved by NATO states. The EU is therefore complimentary to NATO, rather than actually replacing it. NATO will thus continue to be the most important security organisation in Europe. <br />The EU has performed two missions with NATO: Macedonia in 2003 and Bosnia-Herzegovina in 2004.</p>"

Fascism had been defeated. The victors that were still standing were Soviet Communism and liberal democracy in the West. Communism was strong in several European states, including Italy, Greece and France. The isolationist course that was being followed by the Soviet Union and its undemocratic control over its neighbours led to Winston Churchill’s famous “an iron curtain has descended across the Continent” speech at Fulton in 1946. When the pro-democracy government in Czechoslovakia was toppled by a Soviet-backed coup in 1948, US president Harry S. Truman launched a number of measures towards an increased American presence in and in support of Europe. One result of this was the Marshall Plan; an economic aid programme that was offered to all countries in Europe that had been ravaged by war. The Soviet Union refused the Marshall Plan,however, and prevented its satellite states from receiving aid from it. The defensive North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was formed the following year (1949), with Denmark as one of its founder members.<br />NATO’s original purpose was not worded quite so explicitly, but its purpose was to minimise Communist influence in Europe and to deter any potential Soviet attack. In a popular remark, NATO's first secretary general, Lord Ismay, said that the purpose of the alliance was “to keep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down”.<br />When West Germany joined the alliance in 1955 the Soviet Union and its satellites formed the Warsaw Pact to counterbalance to the NATO alliance. The balance of power between NATO and the Warsaw Pact turned out to be highly stable and led to a tense, but long-lasting period of peace in Europe, known as the Cold War. The ideological conflict between the Soviet Union and USA was fought elsewhere, in “proxy” wars: Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>STRUCTURE<br />The NATO alliance is based on the idea of collective responsibility. An attack on one member state is an attack on all member states. This is also known as the “musketeer” oath and is firmly established by Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty,. Article 5 only applies, however, to members’ territories north of the Tropic of Cancer. This means that Hawaii and the Falkland Islands are not covered by Article 5. Another bearing characteristic of NATO is its ideological foundation, which is based on liberal, democratic values rather than any common territorial interests.<br />NATO is divided into a civilian and a military structure to which each member state provides national representation and delegations. <br /><em>The North Atlantic Council</em> is the most important body in NATO. This is the supreme political organ and is where member states’ representatives reach consensus about any political decisions that need to be taken. The chairman of the North Atlantic Council is NATO’s Secretary General (who is elected by the member states). The chairman’s role is to serve as the visible face of the alliance, and to lead and coordinate NATO's international workforce and committees, with the exception of NATO’s Military Committee.<br />A number of civilian committees operate under the auspices of the North Atlantic Council. One of these is the <em>Civil Emergency Planning Committee (CEPC)</em>, which is the top NATO advisory body for the protection of civilian populations and critical infrastructures like transport, public health and communications. The Danish Emergency Management Agency is a member of this committee. Another important committee is NATO's <em>Conference of National Armaments Directors (CNAD)</em>, which is tasked with promoting cooperation among member states on armaments. CNAD is therefore in charge of bringing about increased interoperability across the alliance. NATO also has a large number of committees whose role is to be the “glue” of the alliance: politically, civilian and military.<br /><em>NATO’s Military Committee</em> is comprised of the various countries’ defence chiefs and their representatives. Its main task is to advise the North Atlantic Council on issues to do with military policy and strategic issues. The two strategic commands; <em>Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR)</em>, with headquarters in Belgium and <em>Allied Commander Transformation (ACT)</em> in the USA both report directly to NATO's Military Committee.<br />Despite its name, SECEUR is responsible for the overall command of all NATO operations globally. Unlike the position of Secretary General, SECEUR is traditionally always an American. ACT was created in 2002 and is responsible for the alliance’s military developments in the 21st Century. ACT is therefore in charge of the continued transformation of NATO forces and capacities towards greater efficiency in organisation, with better planning and an increased state of readiness. This is important because there are no fully applicable standardised guidelines among the member states. NATO itself has only very few military capacities, functioning rather as a command structure that facilitates interoperability between the many different national militaries that comprise the alliance.<br />Another important body is <em>NATO’s Parliamentary Assembly,</em> an institution autonomous from NATO in which representatives from parliaments of member states and partnership countries meet to discuss NATO-related issues. The assembly is therefore an important component to strengthen the internal cohesion of the alliance and its democratic links externally.</p>"

With no enemy in the East, the big question was “A defensive alliance against what? And which missions?” <br />T<em>he Partnership for Peace (PfP)</em> programme was therefore created in 1994 to create confidence and cooperations between NATO and European non-member states. NATO uses partnership programmes to strengthen its relationship with non-members through policy-based and practical military cooperations such as training exercises, catastrophe planning and reactions and environmental partnerships etc. <br />In 1996 US president Bill Clinton established that NATO would form the basis for a common European architecture on security that would be able to produce a peaceful, united, democratic continent. This meant the reawakening of NATO’s “Open Door” policy, whereby a unanimous NATO can invite aspiring nations to become part of the alliance.<br />Since then the alliance has expanded eastwards over four instalments, integrating 13 former members of the Warsaw Pact and the former Yugoslavia, the most recent of these being Montenegro in 2017. <br /><em>The NATO-Russia Council</em> was created at the NATO summit in Rome 2002, its purpose being that of an official diplomatic forum in which questions about security and joint projects can be discussed. Its goal is to serve as a forum for consultation and joint decision making, as well as to increase collaborations in a number of areas. This has resulted in several areas in which the two parties have collaborated, including joint initiatives to combat terrorism, military exercises, as well as partnerships in Afghanistan etc. Despite the early success of the Russia Council, mutual disagreements and a worsening relationship between Russia and NATO has caused problems and made partnerships impossible in recent years.<br />Because of the extensive cross-membership between the EU and NATO and their shared values, the two organisations work closely together in a number of areas. At NATO’s 2016 summit the two organisations agreed to increase collaborations with regard to challenges faced by both, such as hybrid threats, increased robustness, building capacity, cyber defence, maritime security and improved military and civilian infrastructure mobilisations during crises.</p>"

It became clear during the wars in the former Yugoslavia that instability outside NATO’s immediate area also impacted stability within the alliance. In an increasingly gobalised world, crises and nations inside and outside Europe can have an impact on the security of the NATO alliance. These include: terrorism, the spreading of ballistic and nuclear capacity, rising extremism in member states, human trafficking and the smuggling of arms and narcotics, trade route disruption, cyber attacks and climate-related challenges. All these issues can be destabilising, both globally and within the alliance. <br />This realisation led to the alliance initiating “out-of-area” operations for the first time, initially in Bosnia and later in Kosovo. After the attack by terrorists on New York in September 2001, NATO announced that this was an Article 5 attack on an ally, and invoked military contributions from member states to the war against terror in Afghanistan and the deployment of NATO surveillance aircraft in the USA. This was the first time NATO had carried out operations outside Europe.<br />In addition to its operations in Afghanistan, the alliance has also taken part in a broad range of missions in the form of: emergency aid operations, combating piracy, enforcing no-fly zones and naval blockades, all at global level.</p>"

This means that the alliance operates within a large number of areas, such as combating terrorism and a general reinforcement of alliance capabilities. As new members join the alliance and it takes on increasing numbers of missions it has had to modernise itself and its structures so as to perform its new tasks in a quick and efficient manner. This has led to changes to NATO’s organisation towards an increasingly streamlined and efficient command structure that is able to quickly deploy the forces required. The alliance is also working to improve its capacity against unconventional forms of aggression, such as cyber attacks, information warfare and attacks on critical infrastructures and energy supplies.<br />The relationship between Russia and NATO has deteriorated so badly since the 2013 annexation of the Crimea by Russia that the NATO-Russia Council collaboration has broken down completely. Although the risk of a conventional attack on the alliance remains low, a number of initiatives have been launched in order to increase alliance cohesion and its willingness and readiness to react in the event of an act of aggression against a member state. These include NATO’s Enhanced Forward Presence, which involves four multi-national battalions, each 1,000 strong. These battalions are stationed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Here, Denmark since 2018 provided personnel (up to apr. 200) to the multi-national force.</p>\n<p> </p>"

Before and after the formation of the Republic of Cyprus, the island has been characterised by tensions between the two population factions and notions of a union with Greece. The ongoing conflict led to the creation of UNFICYP in 1963, invasion by Turkey in 1974, the deployment of Danish UN forces between 1964-1992 and Danish police between 1964-1975.

These disagreements included the diametrically opposed national aspirations of the two groups.<br />Fighting broke out in the Turkish region of the capital Nicosia, which quickly developed into an attempt by Greek Cypriots to force submission by the pro-Turkey section of the population. The conflict spread to other parts of the island and even after just a few days approximately 100 Turkish Cypriots and 80 Greek Cypriots had been killed and numerous civilians had been taken prisoner. Since independence in 1960 both sides had been stockpiling arms and organising rebel groups.<br />The situation in Cyprus was dire. Britain, the island’s former colonial overlord, then convened an emergency meeting between Greece, Turkey and the government of Cyprus. When Cyprus declared independence, the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey had obligated themselves to intervene if Cyprus was to attempt the formation of a union with another country. This meant the stationing of smaller Turkish and Greek contingents on the island, Britain retaining sovereignty over the two military bases.<br />The United Kingdom invited Turkey and Greece to establish a joint peacekeeping mission. This proposal was fruitless, as the Greek and Turkish contingents on the island directly supported the respective sides in the fighting, which meant that the United Kingdom was the sole contributor to the peacekeeping mission.<br />It was then decided that a neutral zone would be established in Nicosia when the Greek-Cypriot and Turkish-Cypriot units were withdrawn to a ceasefire line that had been determined. This became known as “the Green Line” after the ceasefire line that had been actually drawn in green pencil on a map of Cyprus. British troops would also be posted along the length of this line to keep the two populations apart.<br />The two groups were still very keen to continue fighting, however. A political solution was vital. This arrived on 4 March 1964, in the form of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).</p>\n<p><em>Mandate</em> <br />The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 186 on 4 March 1964, in which the government of Cyprus was encouraged to use all necessary means to bring the extensive bloodshed to an end. It also required both sides to show restraint. The Security Council in the resolution called for a UN-administered peacekeeping mission (with consent from the government of Cyprus). The composition and size of the mission was to be decided by the UN Secretary-General in consultation with the governments of Cyprus, Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom.<br />The peacekeeping mission had a fragile mandate to prevent further fighting and, if necessary, to contribute to the restoration of law and order on Cyprus. The mission could use armed force only in self defence.</p>\n<p><em>Decision</em> <br />On 30 April 1964, a unanimous Danish Parliament approved the formation of a permanent Danish UN emergency force that could be deployed upon request from the UN and upon an assessment of the overall situation. With this approval, the Danish government was authorised to deploy Danish troops to UN peacekeeping missions. In practice, this was after discussion in the Danish Foreign Affairs Committee, followed up by ministerial authorisation of the requested funding. The Danish Parliamentary decision does not specifically mention the deployment of a police unit, but the decision in that regard should be considered as a natural consequence of the wording of the UN mandate and the Secretary-General’s decision of 12 April.<br />Shortly thereafter and upon consultation with the Foreign Policy Committee, the Danish government decided to send a Danish contingent to the UN peacekeeping mission in Cyprus.</p>\n<p><em>Contribution</em> <br />DANCON, the Danish contingent, was deployed to “the Green Line” in Nicosia from 1964-1970. The contingent initially numbered about 1,000 personnel. Their mission was to prevent the two sides from further fighting. DANCON and the other UN contingents played an important role in preventing fighting from breaking out once more.<br />In 1968 UNFICYP was able to create a political willingness on both sides to begin negotiations. As a result, UNFICYP could be significantly downscaled and DANCON’s deployment was reduced to about 300 personnel. The contributions from the various countries were reorganised at this time, with DANCON assuming responsibility for the mountainous Lefka District on the north-western region of the island. This area was made up of several larger Turkish enclaves and smaller Turkish villages.<br />DANCON was now based at camps Kokkina, Liminitis, Skouriotissa and Xeros. The Danish military and civilian police also had a base in Dansborg near Xeros. <br />The UN Secretary-General decided on 12 April 1964 to establish a UN police force on Cyprus (UN-CIVPOL). Its role would be to assist Cypriot authorities with many police-related tasks that were the result of the civil war, including murder, hostage-taking and missing persons. Initially, Denmark contributed DANCIVPOL, a police contingent of 40.</p>\n<p><em>Mission</em> <br />DANCON’s mission was to observe both sides’ military forces, as mutual distrust was leading both to maintain a status of high alert. The mission was performed by manning a number of observation posts and by intensive patrolling. During the period, Danish troops were able to keep both sides apart with no notable episodes.<br />DANCON also arranged communication between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots. Many civilian-type duties were performed, such as fixing water and electricity problems, allowing farmers to work in their own fields even though they were in the zone controlled by the other side and safeguarding Turkish Cypriots as they returned to the abandoned villages.</p>\n<p><em>Duration</em> <br />The many violent clashes between 1964 and 1968 were largely due to the return to the island of the former leader of the Greek Cypriot EOKA rebels (General Grivas). He was given command of the Greek Cypriot National Guard that had recently been set up by the government. Greece had also stationed troops on the island, with a combined strength of about two divisions. <br />The situation between the two populations was so tense that there were periods in which open war was imminent between Turkey and Greece. These included the August 1965 Kokkina blockade, during which Turkish aircraft dropped bombs on Greek Cypriot positions and villages. The other side then carried out the Famagusta incident, in which Greek Cypriots launched and offensive on the Turkish Cypriot area of the town of Famagusta, which led to intense fighting. Both episodes led to numerous fatalities and injured.<br />The crisis peaked when General Grivas and his National Guard attacked two Turkish Cypriot villages in 1967. This episode led to direct negotiations between Turkey and Greece, with Turkey restraining an invasion of the island and Greece reducing its forces on Cyprus from 10,000 to 950 personnel. General Grivas was also recalled to Greece, which brought new hope that that situation would de-escalate.<br />Finally, the UN-led negotiations between the two conflicted parties began to make some progress. It became clear, however, that a political solution to the conflict would not be able to result in enosis (unification with Greece). This caused Greek Cypriot supporters of enosis to start attacking the more moderate wing of their own side. The moderates were led by the sitting Greek Cypriot leader, Makarios, who supported cooperation with the Turkish Cypriot population. The situation led to a scenario that began to resemble civil war, heightened by the attempted assassination of Makarios by Greek Cypriots in 1970 and the return of General Grivas to the island in 1971.<br />These events thus signposted the start of the second phase of the conflict.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>INVASION<br />At the beginning of 1970 there had yet to be any notable developments in the negotiations between the Greek and Turkish elements of the population of Cyprus. The negotiating situation had been static since the 1964 crisis and the best result that UNFICYP had been able to achieve had been to prevent the worst of the open fighting between the two sides.<br />In the Greek Cypriot surprise landslide victory of 1970, the Communist party won 37% of the vote. This caused the island’s president, Makarios, to take advantage of the Soviet Union’s increased interest in Cyprus. Upon his return from a state visit to Moscow in 1971, it was announced that he was willing to accept aid from the Soviet Union if other countries were to interfere in the internal affairs of Cyprus. This development was of concern to both Greece and Turkey.<br />Political developments on Cyprus caused the Junta in Athens to send former Greek Cypriot rebel leader General Grivas back to the island to build a resistance movement (EOKA B) to try to topple Makarios from power. Grivas, as a dedicated supporter of enosis, had a different point of view to the Junta in Athens, who only wanted to see Makarios removed from power. This difference of opinion would soon be unimportant, however, when nationalist Dimitrios Ioannidis took power in Athens in 1973 after a military coup.<br />This period was characterised by several bombings, attempted assassinations and political killings carried out by EOKA B and supporters of Makarios, both movements belonging to the Greek Cypriot majority. Internal unrest among the Greek Cypriots led to the ongoing negotiations being delayed and led to a general sense of unease among Turkish Cypriots.<br />On 15 July 1974, with support from Greece, a carefully planned coup d’état was executed against Makarios and the sitting government by EOKA and members of the Greek Cypriot National Guard. Turkey considered this coup to be an attempted annexation by the expansionist Junta in Athens. On 20 July 1974 Turkey launched an invasion of Northern Cyprus, which it claimed had a legal basis in the 1959 Treaty of Guarantee.<br />The Greek Cypriot National Guard immediately mobilised an army of up to 40,000 men and fighting broke out in the many enclaves on both sides of the Green Line. The peacekeeping UN forces were caught in the middle, with no mandate to do anything about the military events going on around them.</p>\n<p><em>Mandate</em> <br />The mandate continued as an extension of Security Council Resolution 186 of 4 March 1964, which encouraged the government of Cyprus to use all means necessary to stop the bloodshed and requiring the parties to show restraint. The Security Council, with the consent of the government of Cyprus, encouraged the creation of a UN peacekeeping mission. The composition and size of the mission was to be decided by the UN Secretary-General in consultation with the governments of Cyprus, Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom.<br />The peacekeeping mission had a fragile mandate to prevent further fighting and, if necessary, to contribute to the restoration of law and order on Cyprus. The mission was therefore only mandated to use force as a means of self-defence.<br />When Turkey invaded Cyprus in 1974 the UN Security Council issued the follow-up Resolution 353, demanding the withdrawal of all foreign military forces from Cyprus and the commencement of peace negotiations by Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom. The Turkish invasion led to several other resolutions that condemned the unilateral invasion of Cyprus and expressed concern about the fate of the many refugees.</p>\n<p><em>Contribution</em> <br />In DANCON’s sector, the day of the invasion was spent making preparations for the eventuality that fighting would reach the Danish area of responsibility. During the evening of 20 July, the Greek Cypriots fired artillery and mortar rounds at the Turkish Cypriot enclaves of Lefka, Limnitis and Kokkina. The enclaves received air support from Turkish aircraft carrying napalm canisters and machine cannon. Much of the incoming fire landed in the DANCON camps, but the preparations that had been made provided effective protection.<br />The day after the invasion the UN withdrew from its observation posts, which was extremely difficult and there were casualties.<br />The Turkish Cypriot enclave of Lefka had to submit to Greek Cypriot pressure but the two sides were successfully brought to the negotiating table. The Greek Cypriot National Guard then took control of Lefka under DANCON’s supervision. DANCON was later able to obtain similar written agreements between three smaller Turkish Cypriot towns and the National Guard. <br />DANCON also provided medical aid to over 100 injured and wounded civilians and military personnel, from both sides. That the fighting did not develop into wholesale attack and mass-murder is largely attributable to DANCON’s management of the situation.<br />As Cyprus found itself in a new situation, the UNIFICYP force was upscaled from approx. 2,300 personnel to 4,400. The same applied to the Danish contingent, which was increased from 220 personnel to 430 over just a few days.<br />The Danish DANCIVPOL civilian police contingent was wound down in 1975 after a decade of service on Cyprus. This was the first ever police peacekeeping mission. Danish police provided about 500 personnel.</p>\n<p><em>Mission</em> <br />The situation was now significantly different after the ceasefire of 16 August 1974. In particular, the Danish camps in Kokkina, Limnitis, Lefka, and Xeros were now in an area controlled by Turkey.<br />In addition to the mandate from 1964 that was still applicable, the UN Secretary-General had also directed UNIFICYP to: 1) monitor troop deployments by both sides, 2) maintain the status quo in the demilitarised zone, 3) monitor the ceasefire, 4) facilitate activities across the ceasefire boundary, 5) provide humanitarian aid all over the island and 6) cooperation with Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot police, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the UN Development Programme (UNDP).<br />A Danish UN Volkswagen bus drove over an anti-tank mine as the observation posts were being remanned after the ceasefire, leading to the deaths of two Danish UN soldiers and another two being wounded.</p>\n<p><em>Duration</em> <br />The political objective of Turkey’s invasion was to prevent enosis and, after subsequent negotiations, to implement a federal solution on the island. Its military objective was to conquer Kyrenia and Nicosia airport. UNFICYP took over responsibility for the airport, however, effectively ending the fighting for this objective. <br />The men who came to power through the Greek Cypriot coup stepped down on 23 July 1974 after pressure from their backers. Makarios, who was now exiled in England, was returned to the office of president. Simultaneous to all these events, the Greek Junta of army officers also collapsed, partly because of what had been happening on Cyprus. It was replaced by a democratic government in Athens. Negotiations towards a ceasefire were able to begin between 25-30 July in Geneva.<br />The ceasefire was short-lived, however, being marred by the gradual expansion by Turkish invading forces of their western bridgehead, while also taking on reinforcements. During the peace negotiations, Turkey presented an ultimatum that involved a cantonal (or local) federation. This was a solution that Greece and the Greek Cypriots were unable to accept.<br />Turkey therefore continued its invasion on 14 August, Turkish forces successfully conquering and controlling about 40% of the island after just three days. Turkey now assumed control of many of the enclaves that had been controlled by the National Guard, including Lefka and Limnitis where DANCON was based.<br />The invasion sent nearly 160,000 Greek Cypriots fleeing toward the southern part of Cyprus. Many of them had been forcibly evicted by the invading Turkish forces.<br />With Turkey’s military gains, the parties entered into a new ceasefire on 16 August 1974. The demilitarised UNFICYP Green Line zone was expanded - the so-called status quo. The Green Line is still a de facto border between Northern and Southern Cyprus.<br />Fighting cost the lives of 9 UN personnel, with another 65 injured. Many war crimes and crimes against humanity were committed by both sides. Thousands of civilians were killed and mistreated during the invasion.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>STABILISATION<br />The demographic composition of the population of Cyprus was rather different after the Turkish invasion in 1974. The many Greek Cypriots who had previously lived in the northern half of the island had fled southwards. Soon after the ceasefire and agreement was made to relocate Turkish Cypriots who still remained in the South to the North if they so desired.<br />Turkish Cypriots had therefore achieved their desired “taksim” - a formal division of the island, with Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots on their own side of the UNFICYP-controlled Green Line. Northern Cyprus then declared independence as the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus. Turkey immediately began to colonise the area, with an estimated 120,000 Turks being relocated to the island from mainland Turkey. This was a clear breach of the Geneva Convention. Turkey also stationed 30,000 soldiers on the island, in breach of the London-Zurich agreement and supplementary treaties as concluded in 1960 by Turkey, Greece, the United Kingdom and political leaders of both the Greek and Turkish Cypriot factions.<br />Turkey had justified its invasion of Cyprus using the Treaty of Guarantee, which forbade Cyprus from forming a union with other states and that compelled Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom to intervene to reassert the 1960 constitution of Cyprus if such a union was formed. After the 1974 military coup on Cyprus, Turkey used the Treaty of Guarantee as a basis for intervention. Its continuation of the invasion and de facto division of the island was a unilateral violation of the Treaty of Guarantee, however. This was also the general consensus view in the international community, which condemned Turkey’s annexation of Northern Cyprus. To this day, the UN and the international community only recognise the Republic of Cyprus as the rightful sovereign state for the entire island.</p>\n<p><em>Mandate</em> <br />The mandate continued as an extension of Resolution 186 of 4 March 1964, which encouraged the government of Cyprus to use all means necessary to stop the bloodshed and requiring the parties to show restraint. In this resolution the Security Council called for a UN-administered peacekeeping mission (with consent from the government of Cyprus). The composition and size of the mission was to be decided by the UN Secretary-General in consultation with the governments of Cyprus, Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom.<br />UNFICYP was also tasked with monitoring the recent ceasefire between the two parties and assisting in the maintenance of a status quo.</p>\n<p><em>Contribution</em> <br />Since 1975, the number of shooting incidents and advances between Turkish and Greek Cypriots has significantly decreased. UNFICYP and DANCON were therefore massively downscaled in 1976. DANCON’s area of responsibility was also moved west when Finland pulled out of the mission in 1977. In addition to DANCON's area of responsibiity in Lefka District and its bases in Kokkina, Limnitis, Skouriotissa and Xerox, DANCON would also have a periodic presence in parts of Kyrenia District and Paphos District after the Finns had left.<br />The status quo was now maintained by surveillance and patrolling of the demilitarised buffer zone.<br />In 1992, Denmark decided to recall its contribution to UNFICYP in light of an assessment that recent conflicts in the former Yugoslavia were of higher priority.<br />In total, about 23,000 Danish soldiers have served in 57 teams in Cyprus from 1964 to 1992. From 1990 to 1992, the Chief of Staff position was held by a Danish brigadier general. A Danish staff officer worked at UNFICYP from 1993 to 1994, after which the mission was over for Denmark. This makes it Denmark’s largest contribution to a UN mission to date.<br />The position of UNFICYP Head of Mission, the diplomatic chief of the mission, was held by a Dane from 2006 to 2008.</p>\n<p><em>Mission</em> <br />The Danish mission was responsible for 17 observation posts in the demilitarised buffer zone, from where both ceasefire lines could be observed. Observation from the observation posts was supplemented with patrols of the Danish area of responsibility. Despite the ongoing conflict, DANCON’s deployment on Cyprus since 1975 was characterised as calm, with no major incidents.</p>\n<p><em>Duration</em> <br />On 15 November 1984, the northern part of Cyprus declared independence as the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Turkey approved the declaration of independence the same day. The UN Security Council responded by issuing Resolutions 541 and 550, in which it stated that the declaration was illegal and requested that no other sovereign states recognise the Turkish-Cypriot declaration of independence.<br />Several unsuccessful attempts have been made by the EU and the UN to resolve the conflict since the Turkish invasion in 1974. Ever since, any solution to the conflict has been stranded politically. There have been changes on the island since 2003, when border crossings between Northern and Southern Cyprus were opened for the first time since 1974.<br />The UNFICYP mission has therefore not succeeded in resolving the underlying ethnic tensions driving the conflict. That said, the mission was justified as it curbed aggressions between Turkish and Greek Cypriots and was able to maintained the ceasefire. Thus, UNFICYP has created the preconditions for reaching a long term peace accord between the two parties on the island.<br />The UNFICYP mission is still active.</p>\n<p> </p>"

                        "text": "<p>BEFORE 1964<br />Since antiquity Cyprus has been a disputed territory that has been occupied by changing régimes. This is largely due to the island’s strategic position as the meeting point of three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa. This is why Cyprus became known as “the island at the crossroads of history”. <br />Cyprus has been populated by Greeks from the Aegean archipelago since antiquity. In 58 BC Cyprus became part of the Roman Empire, later becoming part of the Byzantine Empire, when Greek Cypriots converted to Orthodox Christianity.<br />The Byzantine connection was interrupted when Cyprus was occupied by Crusaders in 1192, after which the island was ruled by Roman Catholics. This situation endured until 1571, when it was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Immediately upon their victory, the Ottomans began their colonisation of Cyprus, sending 20,000 Turks there from Anatolia. <br />Under Ottoman rule, Greek Cypriots were under greater liberty to practise their Orthodox Christian faith than than had been the case under their previous overlords. Except for a special tax on religious minorities, Christians were treated well under the Ottoman system, provided that they did not rebel. The latter was made explicit during the Greek War of Independence in 1821, when the Greek Orthodox Bishop of Cyprus, other religious figures and many Greek Cypriots were executed, purely on the basis of dubious evidence for a conspiracy with mainland Greece.<br />In 1878 the Ottoman régime reluctantly allowed the British to administrate Cyprus on a temporary basis after a major conflict with Russia. In return, the British agreed that it would support the Ottomans both diplomatically and militarily against Russia if the need arose.</p>\n<p>Greek and Turkish Cypriots generally lived in segregation from each other in their own village. Children attended Greek or Turkish schools and intermarriage was rare. The 19th Century saw the clear development of Hellenic nationalism among Greek Cypriots who felt that they were entitled to rule over the island. The basis for this claim was that Greek Cypriots could trace their roots far back in history, and that they were still a majority population. The British were therefore met with Greek Cypriot demands for enosis, the notion of union between Greece and Cyrus.<br />Despite a number of initiatives in support of liberalisation and increased Cypriot autonomy, the ambitions of Greek Cypriots were, however, opposed by the United Kingdom which was, at that time, under obligation to return Cyprus to the Ottomans.<br />When the Ottoman Empire allied with the Central Powers during the First World War, the British decided to annex Cyprus in 1914. The following year, the United Kingdom offered Cyprus to King Constantine the First of Greece, in return for Greek participation in the war. This proposal was rejected, however.<br />When the Ottoman Empire fell, Turkey and the Entente Powers (which included Britain and Greece) concluded a peace treaty in which Turkey renounced all rights to Cyprus. In 1925 Cyprus became an official Crown colony of the United Kingdom.</p>\n<p>Greek Cypriots’ hopes of enosis were renewed after the war. Enosis was taught by Greek teachers in schools and movements that supported union with Greece began to appear, which led to nationalist unrest in 1931.<br />Turkish Cypriots, who had concluded an informal alliance with the British administration to dampen Greek ambition, viewed this with some concern. The antipathy of pro-Turkey Cypriots to enosis was based on the history of the previous union between Greece and Crete, in which the Turkish minority had been driven out as part of a population exchange between Turkey and Greece in 1923.<br />Turkish nationalism began to grow during this period, in particular among young Turkish Cypriots who were inspired by the secular Turkey of Atatürk. The growing national identity of the two groups led to increased internal rivalries about the future of Cyprus.<br />After the Second World War, decolonisation became part of the international agenda. Based on the prospect that Britain would withdraw from Cyprus, Turkey began once again to show an interest in the island that was of such strategic importance. The Cypriot Orthodox Church held an unofficial referendum on enosis in 1950. 96% of Greek Cypriots, who at this point were 80% of the population, voted in favour of union with Greece. The referendum and increasing calls for enosis led to Greece raising the issue of Cyprus’s independence with the UN. This led to Ankara issuing a warning to Britain that any change to the sovereign status of Cyprus that did not take Turkish interests into consideration would force a reaction from Turkey.<br />After elections on Cyprus, the notion of achieving enosis through violent means began to flourish on a broader basis among Greek Cypriots. In 1954 Cypriot-born Green nationalist army colonel Grivas formed the EOKA resistance group, which trained Greek Cypriots in guerilla warfare. The following year EOKA gained broad support when Archbishop Makarios III of Cyprus permitted the commencement of attacks on British military installations on the island.</p>\n<p>Four years of guerilla warfare followed, during which EOKA launched terrorist attacks on colonial authorities, including the Cypriot police. In its fight against EOKA, the British had recruited Turkish Cypriots into the police to such an extent that they now dominated the force in terms of numbers. A counterpart to EOKA was set up in 1958, when Turkish Cypriot Rauf Denktaş founded the paramilitary TMT organisation. This response to the Greek EOKA fought towards “taksim”, a division of Cyprus into regions for pro-Greek and pro-Turkey Cypriots.<br />The direct fighting between EOKA, TMT and British troops and a pro-Turkey police led to strong levels of hostility and rioting, with the two Cypriot factions fighting not only each other, but also the British colonial powers.<br />As the rioting and unrest escalated, Britain, Turkey and Greece had been trying to produce a joint solution to the Cyprus problem. Turkish-Greek relations deteriorated further in 1955, when the Greek minority population in Istanbul was subjected to systematic attacks that were apparently the work of Turkish security services.<br />After several failed attempts to agree upon a solution, both sides had to accept that neither taksim nor enosis would be achievable. A solution was found in the 1959 London-Zurich Agreement between Turkey, Greece, Britain and Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot political leaders (Archbishop Makarios III and Dr. Fazıl Küçük, respectively).<br />The Agreement included a plan for Cyprus’s independence that focused on the island’s two ethnic groups. Examples were that the office of President would be occupied by a Greek Cypriot, with a Turkish Cypriot Vice President, both of whom would have veto rights. A number of supplementary treaties were later added to the London-Zurich Agreement, including the Treaty of Guarantee, in which Cyprus was forbidden from joining a political or economic union with other states, and which obligated Greece, Turkey and the United Kingdom to intervene if Cyprus broke this commitment. The treaty also allowed Britain to retain two military bases on Cyprus, namely Akrotiri and Dhekalia. The supplementary Treaty of Alliance allowed Greece and Turkey to station two small military contingents on the island.</p>\n<p>The Republic of Cyprus was proclaimed on 15 August 1960. Makarios III was made President and Dr Fazıl Küçük was Vice President. The new Cypriot constitution was not well-received by Greek Cypriots, who felt that the division into two ethnic groups, in which pro-Greeks represented 80% of the population was unjust.</p>\n<p>Three years after independence, the relationship between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in government reached a low point. In 1963 it was apparent that there was a mutual unwillingness to achieve political results, which was considered by each faction as part of a strategy to undermine the existing power structure. To resolve the political stalemate, Makarios tried to implement constitutional reforms, which were considered by Turkish Cypriots as a move towards enosis.<br />The massive hostility between the two factions was visible in the secret Akritas plan of 1963, which had been formulated by the Greek Cypriot minister of the interior. The plan contained a number of internal and external strategies to reduce the influence of Turkey and Turkish Cypriots in the country. The objective was still enosis and, in the event of protests by pro-Turkey Cypriots, these were to be quickly and effectively suppressed before foreign powers were able to intervene.<br />There was tumult on 21 December 1963, after a Greek Cypriot police patrol performed a routine check on a Turkish Cypriot couple who were travelling in a taxi. A hostile mob of Turkish Cypriots formed around the police officers, who felt the need to call in reinforcements. Two Turkish Cypriots were killed in the rioting. News of the episode quickly spread across the island and violent fighting broke out between the two communities, often led by the rebel TMT and EOKA groups. In certain areas the fighting turned into a direct massacre of civilian populations, with cultural heritage defaced by both sides. An estimated 360 Turkish Cypriots and 170 Greek Cypriots were killed during the conflict, which lasted a few months.<br />The actual significance of the Akritas plan in relation to events at the end of 1963 is the subject of debate. Makario’s role in formulating the plan and whether it was ever actually implemented remains uncertain.<br />The violence of late 1963 resulted in the deployment of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), which continues to operate at the time of writing.</p>"

Known as Mesopotamia during antiquity and located between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates, it would later become part of the Ottoman Empire and a British area of mandate comprised of three different provinces as decided in 1919. It is a country of tensions; between Sunni and Shia Muslims and Kurds, where oil production is increasing. It gained independence in 1932, surviving the Second World War. It transformed from monarchy to republic and would later be dominated by the Ba’ath Party and Saddam Hussein. <br />It is an area of unrest and extensive internal conflict and Saddam Hussein’s takeover brought no calm. Instead, it brought domestic rebellion, gas attacks against his own population, and a war with Iran that consumed massive resources and cost many human lives. Another disaster was when the life-giving marshland near Basra became arid. Saddam invaded Kuwait in 1990, in an attempt to salvage Iraq’s economy. It led to the First Gulf War and the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. This war marked a new stage of Denmark’s military commitment to international initiatives. Royal Danish Navy Corvette Olfert Fischer was deployed to the Gulf and represented a new approach to participating where required, heralding a new era in which Danish forces would be in demand. It is impossible to talk about Iraq without mentioning weapons of mass destruction, UN mandates, UN inspections, the oil for food programme, no-fly zones and emergency aid to groups like the Kurds. Ultimately, the situation evolved into the Second Gulf War, in which Denmark again participated, this time providing a submarine, a corvette and doctors. The Ba’ath Party and Saddam Hussein are no longer around, but there was still no calm in Iraq. An international security force arrived, with Danish troops serving in the Basra Province together with British troops. Unrest evolved into actual civil war, with improvised explosive devices left on roadsides, rocket attacks on the international forces and their camps and the massive challenge of reasserting Iraq‘s control over its own country. The training of Iraq's military and police became an area of focus, towards enabling them to take over security. The last American troops may well have left the country in 2011, but...<br />Many countries (including Denmark) returned to Iraq as part of the war against ISIL, providing air support to the Kurds as they fought ISIL on the ground, training Iraqi security forces, rebuilding programmes, police missions etc. Danish men and women are still serving in Iraq at the time of writing.<br />You can read about this in further detail in the following seven chapters. They make interesting reading.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>HISTORY</p>\n<p>Iraq has a long history. Ancient Mesopotamia between the rivers Tigris and Euphrates was the place where agriculture was invented and where the first written languages appeared. The Sumerians and Babylonians established some of the very earliest civilisations. The area was central to the Persian Empires and a centre of the Medieval Islamic World, Baghdad being the site of the largest libraries in the World. It was not, however, until after the First World War that Iraq was defined as a country, with borders that were determined more on the basis of British and French interests than the circumstances of the local population. Iraq has three large and a number of smaller population groups and is, at the time of writing, a country plagued by unrest after decades of conflict, sanctions and instability.</p>\n<p><em>Between the two world wars: The Ottomans and the Mandates</em> <br />Iraq was formed as the unification of three provinces which had been part of the Ottoman Empire for centuries. The three provinces were each named after their largest towns: Mosul to the North, Baghdad in the centre and Basra to the South. Kuwait had been linked to Basra, but was given independence with support from Britain in 1913. The First World War broke out the following year and forces from British India were landed near Basra. <br />At the end of the war, most of Iraq was occupied by British Indian troops. To gain their support during the war, the British had promised the Arabs a united state. They had also promised a colony in Syria to the French, which would include Mosul. In the meantime, the war had led to a realisation of the importance of oil. Mosul had large oil deposits and the British were no longer keen on the idea of giving up the area. After discussions during the Versailles negotiations, an agreement was reached with France that allowed Mosul to remain in British hands for the time being. The USA (President Wilson) pushed for self-government, however. The solution thus became that the Arab areas were not given an official status of colonies, but were instead mandates that were assigned to a superpower until they were deemed ready to govern themselves.<br />The three provinces became the British mandate for Mesopotamia in 1920. They had already been under British military control for years and the Iraqis were unhappy about being a colony in all but name when they had been promised an Arab state. Discontent turned into rebellion during the summer of 1920 and was beaten down by the British.<br />The rebellion in Iraq had given the British a nasty shock, however. They therefore brought in Prince Faisal of Mecca, who had helped them during the First World War, with the intention of making him King of Iraq. It was hoped that he would, as a well-known Arab nationalist, be able to satisfy the population. Faisal could not just be place on the throne, however. Iraq was a mandate territory after all, not a colony, so a referendum was held to find out who would be King. Faisal won a massive 90% of votes cast, after one of his two opponents was arrested by British troops and sailed to Sri Lanka and the other was disqualified by the mandate administration because of his age. Faisal was crowned in August 1921 and the mandate was dissolved in 1932. Britain retained a large number of special entitlements and military basis in the country. A British company also had exclusive rights to oil.<br />It was not an easy state to rule. The three Ottoman provinces that became Iraq had seldom been ruled as a united whole. Neither were the new country’s borders designed on the basis of local conditions, but to suit the interests of the colonial powers. 75% of the population were Arabs. 15%-20% were Kurds and the remaining people were Turkmenian and Assyrian minorities. The majority (about 60%) were Shia Muslims. 35% were Sunni Muslims and there were also smaller groups of Christians and Yazidis. The Kurds in particular wanted to be independent rather than part of an Arab-dominated Iraq. The Shia Muslims had historically been more closely connected to Persia to the East. Faisal was himself of Sunni Arab descent and his natural allies were thus Arabic Sunni Muslims. Half of Iraq’s Sunnis were Kurds, however. With some success, Faisal was able to create a narrative of Iraq as a secular Arab state in an attempt to bring about good relations within the country across the boundaries of religion. This was not well-received by the Kurds and other ethnic minorities.</p>\n<p><em>From Kingdom to Republic - Coup and Counter-Coup</em> <br />The West did not view the large mixture of ethnicities and religions as a problem. The fact that there was no clear majority meant that compromise was required, that the various factions would have to share power, and this seemed to be going relatively well. Iraq was known as the “model mandate”. Its formal independence in 1932 was the first and only time that a League of Nations mandate would be replaced by a new member of the league. This was in important victory for the independence movement in Iraq, despite the fact that British influence remained pivotal.<br />Beneath the surface the situation was tense, however. Although Faisal and his supporters referred to themselves as secular, Iraq was dominated by the Sunni Muslim Arabic minority. There was also division with regard to the role of Britain. The history of Iraq that followed was dominated by military coups. The first of these took place in October 1936, but its leader would himself be assassinated the following year. Prior to this, there had already been several uprisings by minorities and desert tribes who did not recognise the government. The next coup took place in 1941 and was led by a fascist group that wanted to end British influence, with support from Nazi Germany. Instead, Iraq was occupied once again by British forces and those responsible for the coup were toppled in favour of a pro-British government.<br />After the Second World War, and despite its formal independence, Iraq was still a monarchy with a government propped up by the British. A new treaty was signed in January 1948. This reduced British influence but still guaranteed an alliance and a number of rights to the British military. It was met with demonstrations that were based on a conflict that was smouldering between the Jews and Arabs in Palestine, which was still controlled by Britain.<br />During the 1950s Iraq was the cornerstone of the Baghdad Pact, which was an alliance of states in the Middle East that was sponsored by the USA and Britain as a check against the Soviet Union. With the decolonisation process, the Israel/Palestine conflict and the Suez war in Egypt, Iraq’s close relationship with the West became increasingly tense. States of Emergency were declared several times because of resistance against the royal family, the government and pro-West policy.<br />Things went wrong in 1958, when Syria and Egypt agreed to form a common Arabic union. This led to a wave of revolution throughout the Arab world. When Jordan was affected by unrest the Iraqi army was ordered south. But when the units that were on their way to the border passed Baghdad on 14 July, two army officers carried out a coup. Roads into the city were closed. The royal family was assassinated and Iraq was declared a republic. There was looting. Supporters of the régime were lynched and the corpse of the former prime minister was dragged through the streets of Baghdad.<br />The new post-revolution government was a mixed bag of Iraqi and pan-Arabic nationalists, a strong Communist party, Kurd and Shiite stakeholders and a wide variety of ideologies. After four coups in a decade, the Ba’ath party came to power. A young man named Saddam Hussein ended up in charge of internal security and, as vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, the supreme authority in the party and, thus, the country.<br />Saddam spearheaded the nationalisation of the oil industry just before the 1973 oil crisis led to rocketing oil prices. The huge revenues were used to establish free school attendance and to build new hospitals. Large amounts were invested in the military to turn Iraq into a regional superpower, to ensure loyalty to the new government and as a means of suppressing all opponents. Saddam quickly became a popular decision-maker, even though he did not win the presidency until 1979.</p>\n<p><em>War, Rebellion and Gassing</em> <br />The ideology of the Ba’ath Party was a united socialist state for all Arabs, regardless of religion. This did not suit the Kurds, but Saddam Hussein’s approach to the issue appeared pragmatic. Anyone could be a member of the party, regardless of ethnicity or religious background, but all Saddam’s opponents were suppressed or put down. Even though Kurds and Shia Muslims were represented in Saddam’s government and in senior echelons of the party, it was still apparent that all the really important positions were occupied by Sunnis. Large elements of the Republican Guard, a large military unit whose role was to prevent military coups, came from Saddam’s home town of Tikrit. Officially, there was room for everyone, but by giving his fellow Sunnis and tribal associates the most important positions and placing them in charge of the suppression of his opponents, Saddam made them an implicit part of state leadership to such a degree that they were bound to the survival of the régime itself.<br />Saddam Hussein had not been president for long before he threw Iraq into the first of several wars that would become failures. The precise land border between Iran and Iraq had long been the subject of disagreement. The two countries had periodically supported opposition groups in the other, but attempts to resolve problems had largely been conducted at the negotiating table rather than on the battlefield. The 1979 revolution that deposed Iran’s Shah and made Iran an Islamic republic would seriously test the relationship between the two countries.<br />Iran wanted to export its revolution, most notably to other Shia Muslims and Iraq’s large Shiite population was an obvious target. To Saddam Hussein and his secular régime, Iran under the Ayatollah represented a threat. Although Iran was a larger country and, on paper, had a larger army than Iraq, Saddam exploited the period of instability that followed the revolution. Hoping that Iran's Arab population would rebel an topple the theocratic régime in a fast and effective war, Iraq invaded its neighbour in September 1980.<br />Iraq won some early victories but would eventually be pushed out of Iran during the eight years of the war, as fighting turned into difficult trench warfare with massive casualties and economic costs to both sides. Iraq was supported by the international community, most obviously Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, who helped finance some of the expenses incurred by the war, but also by the USA, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom. To break the deadlock on the front line, Iraq used large amounts of chemical weapons on various occasions. These were not used only on Iranian troops, however. When Kurds in Northern Iraq tried to exploit the conflict to strengthen their own self-rule, Saddam’s forces forcibly evicted and murdered thousands of Kurds. The attack on the Kurdish town of Halabja, in which 5,000 Kurdish civilians were killed with mustard gas, became the symbol of Saddam Hussein’s callousness and disregard for his own countrymen.<br />The war ended in 1988 with the same borders as when it started. Both countries lay in ruins and over a million people had been killed. Oil production in both countries was badly affected and Iraq’s economy in particular had collapsed because of the expense of the war and the lack of oil revenue.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>THE FIRST GULF WAR</p>\n<p>The war between Iraq and Iran ended with no clear victor. The biggest difference between the time before the war and the time after it was the death toll that exceeded a million, massive destruction in both countries and devastating economic costs, made worse by the loss of eight years of oil revenue. Saddam Hussein came up with a way of fixing Iraq’s financial problems; Kuwait, his tiny neighbour, with all its oil.</p>\n<p><em>What caused the conflict</em> <br />Purely formally, the reason for Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait went back about a century. Kuwait had been ruled during certain periods as part of the Ottoman province of Basra. In two agreements from 1899 and 1913 Britain had made an alliance with the local sheik, making Kuwait a British protectorate during and after the First World War. The official stance in Iraq was therefore that Kuwait was historically part of Iraq, that it had been stolen by the colonial power and that it should be returned to the Iraqi state. Iraq had previously made official claims to Kuwait in 1937 and 1961, using the same argumentation. It seemed to the pan-Arabic and traditionally anti-imperialist Ba’ath Party that now faced a crisis in Iraq, that a victory over one of the remnants from the grand era of imperialism would be a way to regain some of the support it had lost in the Iraqi population.<br />In reality, there were also a number of economic reasons underlying Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait. Iraq was in massive debt after eight years of war with Iran. And as peace returned to the Gulf, oil prices began to fall too. If Saddam was to have the slightest hope of repaying Iraq’s war debts and rebuilding the country’s economy, he needed oil prices to remain high. In OPEC (Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries), Kuwait was one of the opponents of reducing oil production to ensure a return to rising oil prices. During the war they had loaned and granted large amounts of money to Iraq as they also feared the Iranian theocracy and now wanted to earn the money back by selling oil, even at a low price. <br />Saddam Hussein demanded that Kuwait cancelled all Iraq’s debts from the war and loan 10 billion dollars to Iraq to rebuild the country. He also accused Kuwait of slant drilling into oil fields on the Iraqi side of the border.</p>\n<p><em>The invasion of Kuwait.</em> <br />Despite ongoing negotiations about Kuwait’s oil production and the exact border between Iraq and Kuwait, Iraqi forces crossed the border into Kuwait early in the morning of 2 August 1990. The entire country had been occupied before the end of the day and Kuwait’s royal family had fled to Saudi Arabia. According to Iraqi propaganda, the Kuwaiti people had risen up against their traditional monarchy and Iraq fully supported the uprising. Finding Kuwaitis who would speak out to support this representation was extremely difficult, however. Kuwait had been annexed as Iraq’s 19th province before the week was over. <br />Saudi Arabia and other states in the Gulf now felt threatened by Iraq’s experienced military and feared that it would continue to advance, with a view to seizing oil fields on the Saudi side of the border with Kuwait. Osama bin Laden even gave the Saudi king the offer of activating his network of Mujahideen to drive Saddam out of Kuwait. These were the same jihadis who had driven the Soviet Union out of Afghanistan just a few years previously. Instead, he sought support internationally, and particularly from the USA, to guarantee that the invasion of Kuwait was universally condemned and that the borders of the Gulf states were not threatened. Operation Desert Shield began just a few days later, as the Americans began to muster troops in Saudi Arabia. <br />All resistance to the Iraqi state in Kuwait was viciously stamped out. As the military looted Kuwait and took war booty back to Baghdad, even peaceful opposition was met with torture and public executions. To prevent excessive resistance to the Iraqi invasion, Saddam Hussain appointed his cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid (better known as “Chemical Ali” because of the atrocities committed against Iraqi Kurds a few years previously) as governor of the new province.</p>\n<p><em>Response from the International Community</em> <br />Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait was the first major crisis that the international community had faced since the end of the Cold War and Saddam Hussein had seriously miscalculated. Iraq had previously been a close ally of the Soviet Union and he now expected the Soviet Union to use its veto in the UN Security Council to prevent an international action against Iraq. Mikhail Gorbachev had taken the Soviet Union in a new direction internationally and was not looking for a confrontation with the USA. Instead he allowed US president George H.W. Bush to gain the support of the UN to form a coalition against the occupation of Kuwait. <br />A long list of resolutions was adopted in the Security Council, condemning Iraq’s invasion of its neighbour. Resolution 661 (1990) adopted a number of sanctions against Iraq and was followed up by Resolution 665 (1990), which mandated a naval blockade in the Gulf to enforce those sanctions. Denmark's contribution was the deployment of the naval corvette Olfert Fischer as Operation Faraway, which was the first time a Danish warship had been deployed so far from Denmark since the colonial era.<br />The pivotal resolution was Resolution 678, which was adopted at the end of November 1990. This resolution ordered Iraq to pull out of Kuwait completely before 15 January the following year. Non-compliance would mandate all states, in support of Kuwait, to use all necessary means to drive Iraqi troops out and liberate Kuwait. The USA began to assemble a broad coalition to fight the war that would follow if Saddam Hussein failed to comply with the requirements of the resolution. There was a particular desire to unite as many Arab states as possible, to prevent the alliance from being presented in Iraqi propaganda as an attack by foreign powers.<br />Saddam tried to associate the Kuwait conflict with other issues in the Arabic world. He tried to present the willingness of President Bush to fight a war to enforce a UN Resolution that condemned the occupation of an oil-rich country like Kuwait as bare-faced hypocrisy because of the USA’s uncritical support of Israel, despite the latter’s occupation of the Palestinian West Bank and the Southern Lebanon, as well as permitting the presence of Syrian troops in the Lebanon, which had also been condemned by the UN. Yemen, Sudan and the PLO therefore sided with Iraq, but did not contribute to the war, while Jordan tried to find a neutral position as a diplomatic negotiator. A number of Arabic states took part in the coalition, however. Saudi Arabia and the smaller Gulf states were keen participants. Morocco, Egypt and Syria also contributed, despite massive protests within their own populations.</p>\n<p><em>Desert Storm</em> <br />Iraq did not comply with the UN resolution and when the deadline expired on 15 January Kuwait was still occupied by Iraqi troops. The first phase of Operation Desert Storm commenced the following day. The US-led coalition began a massive air and artillery bombardment of targets in Kuwait and Iraq. The first attacks were on anti-aircraft batteries and Iraqi air force bases, in order to gain air supremacy. Next to be bombarded were command posts and electrical stations to prevent communications between Iraq's military leaders and front-line units. The final part of the air campaign focused on the Iraqi troops themselves, before commencing the final offensive to free Kuwait from Iraqi occupation.<br />Saddam Hussein still wanted to drive a wedge between the members of the coalition, however. To show that his war rhetoric was serious, he fired a number of SCUD missiles at Israel in the hope that Arabic members would feel the need to pull out and in the hope that Israel would be provoked into getting involved. The missile attacks caused no serious damage in Israel, as they were not precise over longer ranges. The Israeli Air Force was prepared to launch a number of retaliatory attacks on Iraq, but the US leadership was able to talk Israel out of doing so, as direct Israeli participation would potentially isolate the Egyptian and Syrian contributions from the rest of the coalition.<br />SCUD missiles were also fired at civilian and military targets in Saudi Arabia. The governments of Israel and Saudi Arabia both distributed gas masks to their civilian populations in case Iraq used chemical weapons. Iraq also attempted a land offensive and took the oil fields and refinery at Hafji on the Saudi side of the border with Kuwait, but was forced to withdraw back to Kuwait after a two day long counter attack by Saudi and US forces.<br />On 24 February, after a five week bombardment, the coalition began a major offensive along the Saudi border with Kuwait and Southern Iraq, to finally drive Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. In response the Iraqis set fire to oil wells and pumping stations in Kuwait as they retreated from the coalition attack. Images of the many oil fires became one of many international symbols of the war.<br />The withdrawal from Kuwait while under attack by the coalition was disorganised, out of control chaos. The motorway between Kuwait and Basra in Southern Iraq became known as “the Highway of Death” when large numbers of Iraqi troops were trapped in a traffic jam of tanks and retreating soldiers while under coalition fire.<br />A ceasefire was declared on 28 February, just 100 hours after the offensive had begun. The Iraqi army had been forced out of Kuwait and had also been defeated in Southern Iraq. Although various members of the coalition wanted to continue onwards to Baghdad and overthrow Saddam Hussein, the UN mandate expressly permitted only the liberation of Kuwait, not the invasion of Iraq. It was instead hoped that the complete and utter defeat and continued sanctions would lead to a coup against Saddam by dissatisfied generals, or a popular revolt that would topple him.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>IRAQ IN THE 90S</p>\n<p>The end of the war for Kuwait was not the end of Saddam Hussein’s problems. Over the decade that followed, he faced several uprisings by his own population and the introduction of no-fly zones over parts of the country. And meanwhile, Iraq continued to face a number of sanctions from the international community. The long and ongoing debate about whether Iraq still possessed weapons of mass destruction would lead to the war that followed in 2003 and that would be the final death blow to Saddam Hussein and the Ba’ath Party.</p>\n<p><em>Defeat led to rebellion.</em> <br />The Ba’ath régime was on shaky ground after the liberation of Kuwait and the defeat of the Iraqi army. In addition to the problems that were the result of the years of war against Iran, that were supposed to have been fixed with Kuwaiti oil, Iraq was now in an even worse state after another expensive war during which the country’s infrastructure had been bombarded and large amounts of military hardware had been destroyed. Radio stations sponsored by the USA had also encouraged thoughts of revolution in the Iraqi people, with half promises of military aid if they toppled Saddam.<br />The USA had probably expected to see a coup carried out by dissatisfied generals or the inner circle of Saddam's government, rather than popular rebellion by suppressed elements of Iraq's population. Shia Muslims in southern and eastern parts of the country and Kurds in the North both began militant rebellions against the Ba’ath régime in Baghdad. The anticipated support for the rebels did not initially appear, as the USA feared that a successful Shia rebellion would increase Iranian influence in the country, while Turkey (a member of NATO) opposed anything that remotely resembled an independent Kurdish territory (so as to prevent an escalation of Turkey’s conflict against its own Kurdish minority).<br />Iraq’s army had suffered a massive defeat in Kuwait, but still had elements that were battle-worthy. After a quick reorganisation, combat-ready units were deployed against the two rebel movements. During March and April 1991, civil war raged between the Iraqi régime and rebels to the North and South. The régime was known for taking extreme action to put down internal resistance, especially after its use of chemical gas weapons against Kurdish towns at the end of the 1980s. Saddam Hussein was able to defeat the rebellion in the South, partly by draining large areas of marshland that had been used as a base by the rebels and that was the local population’s basis for existence, while fighting in the Kurdish regions to the North continued to drag out. Even though the Shia Muslims had been left with no influence in Iraq, this fighting was the first time that they had been directly targeted by the régime’s armed forces.<br />No-fly zones were set up to protect remaining rebels and refugees at the instigation of the British and Americans during 1991, in both the northern and southern regions of the country. The poison gas attacks on Kurdish areas in 1987-88 had been carried out by the Iraqi air force. Nobody wanted this to be repeated, so airspace was patrolled by Western aircraft, preventing Saddam’s air force from carrying out attacks on the rebels. In practice, the air support from the West also covered a Kurdish area in northern Iraq that finally was able to gain self-government after many years of fighting against the Iraqi state. Baghdad was unhappy about this situation and tensions in the borderlands between Kurdish and Iraqi areas remained high. When the Kurds ended up fighting amongst themselves, the Iraqi army attempted an offensive in 1996 that was quickly responded to by a number of American cruise missiles fired at Iraqi targets.</p>\n<p><em>Sanctions and inspections to find weapons of mass destruction</em> <br />Iraq had been pushed out of Kuwait. A UN observer mission called UNIKOM was deployed to make sure that the Iraqi army stayed on the right side of the border. Iraq was still subject to a large number of sanctions, primarily those mandated after the invasion of Kuwait in Security Council Resolution 661 (1990). These sanctions required of UN member states that they blocked all trade with Iraq, except for the humanitarian supply of medicines and food. Iraq was barely able to purchase these essentials, as all export out of Iraq was also prohibited by the resolution, which meant that it was unable to pay for medicines etc. <br />When the war ended the UN Security Council adopted another resolution to maintain the existing sanctions. This resolution (687 of 1991) also included a new demand that Iraq should pay war reparations to Kuwait. If the sanctions were to be lifted, Iraq would have to hand over and destroy its entire arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, all rockets and missiles with a range exceeding 150km and guarantee that it would not develop atomic weapons. The United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) was set up to monitor compliance with these demands, alongside experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The Iraqi authorities were required to grant the commission’s inspectors free access and to cooperate in full.<br />Wording at the end of Resolution 687 would turn out to be of pivotal importance. In the final paragraph of the resolution, the Security Council decided to “take such further steps as may be required for the implementation of the present resolution and to secure peace and security in the area”. This would be interpreted (an interpretation that would also be criticised) as a mandate to intervene if Iraq retained weapons of mass destruction.<br />Large quantities of chemical and biological weapons were discovered, handed over and destroyed. Several installations where such weapons were being manufactured were also visited by the inspectors and subsequently destroyed. Saddam Hussein and his régime were not always cooperative and it was feared that Iraq was still concealing depots of poison gas or production facilities. The Ba’ath Party also criticised UNSCOM’s use of Israeli and American experts to analyse some of the material that had been discovered and air photographs of possible installations, as both countries were enemies of Iraq and would be able to use this information for the purpose of espionage.<br />When UNSCOM reported that its inspectors were being denied free access and that Iraqi authorities were not always willing to cooperate, the United Kingdom and USA launched Operation Desert Fox in 1998. This was a four-day bombing campaign against Iraq, carried out with cruise missiles and aircraft. President Clinton’s official announcement was that the targets had been development and manufacturing facilities for weapons of mass destruction and that they had now been destroyed. Iraq denied this, claiming instead that the targets had been barracks and the headquarters of Saddam Hussein’s elite Republican Guard units. UNSCOM’s personnel had been evacuated before the attacks were launched. In response, Saddam Hussein decided to stop cooperating with INSCOM and did not allow the inspectors to return. A new United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) was set up, but Iraq’s government continued to grant them access to the country.</p>\n<p><em>The Effect of Sanctions: Oil for Food</em> <br />The continuation of sanctions after the 1991 ceasefire was intended to pressurise Iraq into reporting its weapons of mass destruction to the inspectors and to convince army generals or the Baghdad inner circle to perform a coup against Saddam’s government. What actually happened was that the ordinary population bore the brunt of the sanctions, not the leadership of the régime. Parts of Iraq lay in ruins after many years of war and the country’s economy was highly dependent on continued revenue from oil exports. The sanctions made it impossible to generate income to fund the rebuilding of a broken country.<br />Trading with Iraq was forbidden, but the long borders through the Syrian desert to the West and the mountains of Iran and Turkey to the East and North were hard to keep under check. The Iraqi régime was not particularly interested in preventing cross-border smuggling either. The Bedouin tribes have always moved freely across the desert and, thanks to illegal trade, some tribal leaders had made enormous profits and Shia leaders with contacts in Iran were able to use them as a means of trade. When Iraq’s welfare state collapsed after war and sanctions, many people were able to find not only community but also security and economic aid from religious communities and tribes instead of the state.<br />The sanctions were broadly criticised, as organisations like UNICEF reported on wide famine and malnutrition in Iraq and a tripling of child mortality rates. In 1995 the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 986, launching what is often referred to as the “Food for Oil” programme. This program allowed Iraq to export a fixed quantity of oil and to use the revenue to purchase food for the Iraqi population.<br />The programme began at the end of 1996. From 1997 the first oil revenue began to return to Iraq. The funds would not go to Iraq directly, however. The UN administrated the oil revenue, allocating funds for debt repayment, war reparations to Kuwait and payment for the UN operations in Iraq. Iraq was allowed to use what was left to pay for food and other essentials. All imports had to be approved by UNSCOM, to be sure that Iraq was not importing arms or similar products.<br />What ended up happening was that the régime saw most of the benefits, which only reached the population to a limited extent. It is believed that Saddam Hussein and his inner circle earned a large amount of money from the programme. The food and medicines that were imported were never going to be enough for Iraq’s large population as it was. The first people to receive anything were the régime’s most loyal supporters and people in cities. People in rural communities received significantly less. Those who the government considered “suspicious” were completely neglected.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>THE SECOND GULF WAR</p>\n<p>As Iraq suffered under sanctions, the discussion about weapons of mass destruction continued. After the attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001, there were new grounds to fear a hostile régime that might be in possession of dangerous armaments. There was extensive debate in Denmark and the international community about whether UNSCOM had destroyed all Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction and whether the Iraqis had presented sufficient documentation that everything had been destroyed. Another subject of discussion was whether previous UN resolutions mandated further intervention. There was also a discussion of whether the USA and its allies could unilaterally invade Iraq, despite a lack of support for such action in the Security Council, and of if and how Denmark should contribute to such action, with or without a direct resolution.</p>\n<p><em>The Fear of Weapons of Mass Destruction</em> <br />In response to the 11 September 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, President George W. Bush declared a war on terror. In addition to toppling the Taliban régime in Afghanistan and launching Operation Active Endeavour in the Mediterranean, this led to renewed debate about whether Saddam Hussein still had access to weapons of mass destruction. Many feared that a hostile dictator like Saddam would be able to supply such weaponry to terrorists. He had, after all, had no hesitations when it came to using chemical weapons against his own population during the 1980s.<br />UN and IAEA UNSCOM inspectors had destroyed large quantities of weapons of mass destruction during the 1990s, but the Iraqi régime had failed to cooperate unconditionally, so it was feared that it still had hidden arms depots or production facilities. Inspectors had been unable to enter Iraq and it was possible that production had commenced anew, despite the sanctions which prevented non-covert imports of production materials. During 2002 there was therefore a broad debate about what could and should be done.<br />President Bush and his government appeared certain that Iraq was still concealing weapons of mass destruction and that the Iraqi régime was in contact with al-Qaeda. Saddam Hussein denied all allegations, but continued to prevent the entry of weapons inspectors into Iraq due to fear of espionage and resentment about having been attacked in 1998.<br />The official argument for a war against Iraq was the fear that it was still concealing weapons of mass destruction and that it had failed to cooperate unconditionally on their destruction. Official US policy since 1998 had, in practice, been to try and force a change of régime in Iraq, which is what many people viewed as the de facto reason. Many people envisaged the possibility of a new administration that was more friendly and would assure stability in the Gulf.<br />President Bush already had several allies on whom he could rely. The first and most important of these was British prime minister Tony Blair, the United Kingdom being the USA's closest ally and partner. Other European leaders, were also willing to support Bush, including the Danish Government. The EU was divided on this issue, however. France and Germany in particular both opposed the eventuality of a war in Iraq.</p>\n<p><em>The Role of the UN</em> <br />The global community was divided, as was the American government. Even accepting that Iraq was concealing weapons of mass destruction and represented a threat, there was some discussion as to whether an intervention would actually be legal. Previous Security Council resolutions had legitimised the use of force in relation to Kuwait and, after the war, the destruction of weapons of mass destruction was linked to the ceasefire conditions in Resolution 687. Was a new resolution even required, bearing in mind that Saddam Hussein had failed to fully cooperate with the weapons inspectors?<br />President Bush had the support of US Congress to use all necessary means to assure Iraq’s disarmament, which also included an invasion. Members of his government were not very keen on using the UN resolution as justification and wanted to obtain a new resolution that would definitively legitimise such an invasion. Encouraged by Blair and US foreign minister Colin Powell, it was decided that an attempt would be made to gain the support of the Security Council.<br />The Security Council adopted Resolution 1441 on 8 November 2002. Prior to this, there had been extensive debate about finding the right wording to gain the approval of all members of the Security Council. The resolution required Iraq’s unconditional cooperation with the inspectors that would return to the country. This was adopted unanimously, but only after France, Russia and China had stood firm that the wording would not automatically trigger a war if Iraq failed to comply with the resolution, but that there would be “serious consequences”. The resolution did not explicitly specify what these “serious consequences” would be, so there was some discussion of the legality of an invasion if the Security Council had not decided in advance that this would be the consequence.<br />Regardless of all this, the weapons inspectors returned to Iraq. Led by Hans Blix from Sweden, the inspectors prepared several reports about Iraq’s disarmament during the months that followed. Each report documented that the Iraqis were cooperating, but that the process was slow and obstructive. These reports were interpreted differently. According to opponents of a war they showed that disarmament was underway and that all that was needed was a little more time. According to Colin Powell the reports proved simply that Iraq was unwilling to cooperate.<br />As the Americans mustered troops and prepared for war, it seemed as though war was inevitable. On 10 March UN Secretary General Kofi Annan announced that a war that was not supported by the Security Council would be a violation of the UN treaty, while the Americans maintained that the previous resolution was adequate justification, while conceding that a new resolution would be the best scenario. An attempt was made to obtain a new resolution, but when this failed Bush announced on 17 March that Saddam Hussein had 48 hours to leave Iraq, or war would be declared.</p>\n<p><em>Denmark’s discussion</em> <br />There was a similar discussion in Denmark; in the media, in parliament and among government ministers. Joining a war in Iraq was a big decision, especially when there was no direct UN mandate to do so. Denmark had already taken part in Operation Allied Force just a few years previously, with no mandate from the UN (air bombing by a united NATO against Serbia, while it was carrying out ethnic cleansing in Kosovo). Certain politicians deemed that the bombing of Serbia was not the same as an invasion to force a change of régime in Iraq on the basis of claims about the presence of weapons of mass destruction.<br />In mid-November, when Denmark and a number of other countries were asked to contribute to a potential war, the Danish Prime Minister was generally inclined to agree, even though it was uncertain whether or not the war would happen and whether or not there would be a UN mandate. At a meeting of the Danish Foreign Affairs Committee a few days later, the Social Democrats, Radikale Venstre (the Danish Social Liberal Party) and Dansk Folkeparti (the Danish People's Party) gave their approval to the government for a Danish contribution to put pressure on Saddam Hussein. This was based on the assumption that there would be a new ruling from the UN.<br />Like their British and American counterparts, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark prepared a memo stating its interpretation that Resolution 1441 in combination with previous resolutions was sufficient mandate for the use of force against Iraq. This was in opposition to Kofi Annan’s assessment and it would therefore be difficult to obtain a broad parliamentary majority that would support Danish participation.<br />The Danish Prime Minister tried to persuade the opposition to form a broad majority, but for a downscaled deployment. He thus proposed a contribution that would be comprised of the submarine Sælen and the corvette Olfert Fischer, which had participated in 1991, and a team of doctors. The opposition did not accept this as they did not consider an invasion to be legal under international law.<br />On 18 March 2003 the government put proposal B118 on Danish military participation to the Danish Parliament. Although the debate that followed was very much about whether Iraq actually had any weapons of mass destruction, the proposal and its commentary did not specifically state that this was the justification for the war. The reason for the intervention was that Saddam Hussein was failing to cooperate with the weapons inspectors and was not complying with the requirements of the decade old ceasefire and the UN Security Council resolution.<br />There was massive debate on the issue in parliament and in the population at large. Eventually the proposal was passed by the Danish Parliament on 21 March, after an emergency reading. With 61 votes in favour and 50 against, the Danish Parliament had narrowly approved a Danish contribution to the coalition mission in Iraq. The war had already begun the previous day, on 20 March 2003.</p>\n<p><em>The Coalition of the Willing.</em> <br />Bush and Blair stated that even though the whole world was not willing to take part, a coalition could be formed of countries that were willing to do so. Over 40 countries joined this Coalition of the Willing, including Denmark. In practice, the invasion force itself was comprised of forces from the USA, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland, in partnership with Kurdish militias from northern Iraq.<br />The original plan was to simultaneously invade Iraq from the North via Turkey and the South via Kuwait. The situation surrounding the UN mandate meant that Turkey’s government did not permit an invasion through its territory. Special forces units were deployed in northern Iraq to support the coalition’s Kurdish allies,while the main force launched its attack from Kuwait.<br />The war began officially on the morning of 20 March, shortly after the deadline President Bush had given Saddam Hussein had run out. As special forces units were already deployed inside Iraq, with an extensive attack on Iraqi positions from the air, a Kurdish offensive in the North and with the overall combined manpower of the coalition force attacking from the South, there was little the Iraqi army could do by way of resistance. Since 1990 it had been virtually impossible for Iraq’s military to acquire new military hardware or even spare parts to service what remained, much of its material having been lost in the retreat from Kuwait in 1991.<br />It took just three weeks for coalition forces to defeat the Iraqi army on the road from Kuwait to the North. Baghdad was taken in early April, by which time most of Iraq was under coalition military control, although fighting continued at various pockets of resistance in different locations. As the régime lost control of Iraq, Saddam’s palaces, government buildings and even hospitals were looted. Baghdad Museum of Antiquities was completely stripped of items of value. Of greater concern to the future of Iraq was the looting of numerous arms depots as their guards fled or deserted.<br />Looting was not the only thing shown on the World’s TV channels. Firdos Square in central Baghdad was the site of a famous 12-metre tall statue of Saddam Hussein, which had been erected a year previously to celebrate the dictator’s 65th birthday. A chain was fixed to it and, pulled by an American armoured vehicle, the monument was toppled. Saddam himself had disappeared and his most loyal forces continued to battle coalition forces.</p>\n<p><em>After the Invasion.</em> <br />On 1 May 2003, in front of a large banner displaying the words “Mission Accomplished”, President Bush held a speech on board the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. In the speech he declared that the war had been won, that major combat engagements were concluded and that the coalition was ready to start rebuilding Iraq.<br />The war in Iraq was not over, however. Saddam was still at liberty and the Ba’ath Party that had governed Iraq with an iron fist for decades would have to be replaced by a democratic system that had space for all of Iraq’s ethnic and religious groups. Meanwhile, no weapons of mass destruction had been found, despite steadfast attempts to locate them.<br />The power vacuum that led to looting was not filled immediately by coalition forces, who were neither trained nor had the manpower to act as police officers. Meanwhile, decisions about Iraq's immediate future would be made by the American administration. Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was set up in May to govern Iraq during the transition period until it was possible for elections to be held.<br />With American diplomat Paul Bremer in charge, CPA dismissed every single Ba’ath Party member, in complete disregard of the fact that party membership had, for many, been more about being able to work in state administration rather than any particular political convictions. The Iraqi army was then officially disbanded, instead of using the 400,000 soldiers to maintain law and order in the country. Finally, he cancelled the local elections that had initially been planned, instead setting up a government that was mainly comprised of Iraqi exiles. For Iraq, this decision meant that its local leaders had lost all influence, that 400,000 young men with military training were out of work, and that large numbers of dismissed officials now had future prospects or salaries to feed their families. All this, in a country that now had a massive power vacuum.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>2004 TO 2011</p>\n<p>With Saddam Hussein and the Ba’ath Party out of the picture and large parts of its infrastructure in ruins, Iraq was thrown into a power vacuum. The state was no longer able to guarantee security or welfare and the coalition forces were viewed by certain factions as an occupying power. Many people in Iraq found security within their more traditional networks. As an extended family, clans were able to help their members. Religious and ethnic groups came together as the most important unifier, as opposed to life under the secular welfare state that the Ba’ath régime had created using oil revenue. The invasion force was replaced by a stabilising force and a democratic Iraqi government was gradually put together.</p>\n<p><em>CPA &amp; The Multinational Security Command</em> <br />As no weapons of mass destruction or evidence that Saddam Hussein had been in contact with al-Qaeda were discovered, the coalition instead decided to prioritise the democratisation of Iraq and liberation from the Ba’ath Party dictatorship. Many Iraqis saw this as somewhat hollow. When the British invaded the area during the First World War, the also came as “liberators”. Instead, it turned out that they pushed out local resistance and made Iraq a very thinly-disguised colony using the mandate system.<br />Under CPA a new Multinational Security Command was set up, rather than an occupation by former invasion forces. Iraq was divided into four zones. Two of these were administrated by the USA, one by Poland in partnership with various other countries and one by the United Kingdom. The Danish forces were deployed to the British zone. A total of 40 countries were members of this force. In addition to Denmark and the three countries with their own zones of responsibility, contributions came from countries as diverse as Thailand, Mongolia, Japan, the Czech Republic, Spain, Italy, Australia, Kazakhstan, the Ukraine and elsewhere.<br />The Danish Parliament decided in 2003 that Denmark would contribute to the Multinational Security Command. Although there was still no UN mandate, this proposal had a broader parliamentary majority than the original proposal on participation in the war two months previously. The Danish contingent was deployed near Basra in the British zone, an area that was believed to be relatively peaceful, as its population was largely Shia Muslims who had been suppressed by Saddam’s régime. A smaller contribution from Lithuania was attached to the Danish contingent.<br />The initial period was characterised by instability in the regions north of the British zone. One of the reasons for this was that the leadership of the Ba’ath Party had been dominated by Sunni Muslims like Saddam himself. And in areas where there was a Sunni presence the coalition forces were broadly unpopular. Loyal remnants of the Ba’ath Party and Iraqi military continued the fighting, largely employing guerilla tactics.<br />In Resolution 1483 of May 2003, the UN Security Council recognised the coalition as a occupying power under international law, with CPA as a legitimate transitional government. The many sanctions that had been imposed on Iraq since 1990 were also lifted and the coalition was required only to use oil revenue from Iraq for the benefit of the people of Iraq. United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI) was also set up in August 2003 (in Resolution 1500). Its task was to support the process of democratisation, to advise Iraqi authorities and to coordinate humanitarian work in the country. Just five days after it was set up, UNAMI’s headquarters in Baghdad was car bombed in an attack that killed 22 people, including the UN’s special representative to Iraq. Much of the work that was being done by the UN and its personnel was then relocated to Jordan.</p>\n<p><em>Independence during imminent civil war</em> <br />The Iraqi Governing Council (IGC) was under CPA’s control and was mainly comprised of Iraqis who had lived in exile. In practical terms, most power was still in the hands of CPA, but IGS was responsible for certain key areas. One of their tasks was thus to put together a constitution for Iraq to enable an election. IGC also represented Iraq in the UN and the Arab League.<br />Initial resistance to the occupation mainly came from the remnants of the secular Ba’ath Party that was supported by Sunni Muslims who feared suppression in a democratic state by the Shia majority. Over time, this resistance turned into more tangible conflicts that had become sectarian and were supported by al-Qaeda fighters who had entered Iraq, with attacks on Shia Muslims and religious sites.<br />The Shia Muslims were far from innocent in this regard too, although they were initially more open to the coalition forces. A Shiite religious leader called Muqtada al-Sadre proclaimed as early as July 2003 that the transitional government was a puppet of the occupying powers and officially began to form a militia. During the previous looting after the fall of Saddam, his supporters had made their presence known in Baghdad’s slums by organising local Shiites to patrol the area and maintain a form of law and order. There were similar patterns at various other locations in Iraq, apparently being organised within religious communities or extended family networks. <br />In parallel to all this was a number of criminal organisations, who did not want to see a strong central authority. Some of these had roots in the border smuggling of the sanctions era, while others had appeared in the wake and chaos of the events that followed the invasion. Numerous Iraqi soldiers and officials were expelled by CPA, giving the criminal groups, religious militias and clan communities a large recruitment base. Despite hopes that resistance would ebb out when Saddam Hussein was finally captured in December 2003, Iraq remained unstable and attacks continued on coalition forces in the country.<br />CPA and IGC were replaced by an Iraqi transitional government in June 2004. Although elections and a new constitution were not yet ready, Iraq was at this point officially an independent sovereign state. Coalition forces maintained their presence in Iraq, however, as the situation was far from peaceful and there was a fear that the new government would collapse if coalition forces were withdrawn. Their presence was also at the formal invitation of Iraq’s own government, rather than having the status of an occupying force.<br />The conflict escalated over the years that followed. Despite this, the first ever free elections were held in Iraq in January 2005. Over 100 polling stations suffered armed attacks on election day and some stations had voting rates of less then ten per cent. International observers deemed the election to be legitimate, however, and the new transitional government was authorised to write an actual constitution, which would be finally passed in the autumn of 2005.<br />Although coalition forces helped as best they could, Iraq’s government found it difficult to recruit personnel, and particularly police officers. This was not particularly because of hostility among the population, but was rather due to the fact that al-Qaeda, the remnants of the Ba’ath Party and other groups were willing not only to attack civilian targets, but often specifically targeted police officers and their families. They were unable to defeat coalition forces militarily, but had the capability to maintain instability in the country, thus signalling to the population that collaboration with the government and the coalition could have serious consequences.</p>\n<p><em>The Surge and The Long Road Home.</em> <br />Assuring stability and battling opponents were not the only tasks of the international forces in Iraq. One of their most important missions, particularly in the long term, was to train and prepare local security forces to be able to assume control so the multinational force could be recalled. This was easier said than done.<br />As American troops fought a tough battle to control the town of Fallujah and other areas in the “Sunni Triangle” north of Baghdad, the Danish and British troops in the southern part of the country spent a long time dealing with problems other than direct combat engagements. The problem in this zone was local criminals and the new Shia-dominated Iraqi police corps.<br />On 22 February 2006 a bomb detonated inside the al-Askari mosque in the town of Samarra. Al-Qaeda in Iraq had carried out this attack, which caused the dome to collapse on one of the most important holy sites to Shia Muslims. Conflict had already smouldered between these groups and the Askari bombing was the spark that triggered a civil war. The conflict deteriorated over the next two years, with numerous attacks on militias, civilians and the international forces. The conflict was not just between two religious factions, but often between rival militias who were involved in infighting, despite belonging to the same religious faction.<br />Conflict also escalated in the mainly Shia area that comprised the Danish and British area of operations. Rocket attacks on bases became more and more frequent. The threat of improvised roadside explosive devices and ambushes was greater than it had been previously. In the first few years of the war, locals would often wave when the troops rolled out to visit schools etc. that were being renovated as part of the work towards rebuilding the region. Now, sallies of this type were only performed if necessary. The coalition was beginning to lose control of Basra and other important towns to al-Sadr’s militia. <br />After years of war and conflict, several countries began to pull out of Iraq. The first withdrawals already took place in 2004, but from 2006 in particular, the increase in fatalities became part of the agenda in all the participating countries. On 21 February 2007 both Denmark and the United Kingdom announced that they would be withdrawing their combat troops. Danish forces would be recalled in August that year and British forces would be massively reduced over the years that followed. Just before these announcements, President Bush had announced that the American presence would be massively reinforced in a “surge” to stabilise Iraq before the Americans too would pull out.<br />The withdrawal had to a certain degree been at the request of the Iraqi government, who wanted to assume greater responsibility for the security of its own country. Although the situation only deteriorated during the months that followed the British and Danish withdrawal, Iraq’s central government was able, with American support, to regain control of the Basra region after a major offensive in 2008.<br />“The Surge” turned out to be highly effective. The increased numbers of American troops helped to increase stability. Dialogue was also extended with a number of clan and militia leaders, who were paid economic aid and offered a role in the Iraqi state in return for ending their rebellions and helping instead to defeat al-Qaeda and other extremist factions.<br />Iraq was now a “relatively” calm country, compared with previous years which had resembled civil war and the final withdrawal agreement was negotiated. The agreement between the Iraqi and American governments was concluded in 2008, leading to a gradual phasing out of combat units starting in towns with a deadline of 30 June 2009. All American troops were to have left the country by the end of 2011. The final combat units left Iraq on the orders of President Obama on 19 August 2010. The remaining American troops in Iraq would only assist in the training of the Iraqi army until they too departed at around Christmas 2011.</p>"

There were still several armed groups that were not under direct state control and others that continued to fight against the government. Shia Muslim prime minister Nuori al-Maliki was viewed by many Iraqis as a sectarian who always sided with Shiites and wanted to suppress the Sunni minority, whose militias were behind most resistance against the state. There were still celebrations, however, when Iraq was once again free of international forces. Events in the region and in neighbouring Syria in particular threw Iraq into another civil war that necessitated the return of a new international coalition to Iraq.</p>\n<p><em>The Arabic Spring and Islamic State</em> <br />The final American forces left Iraq in 2011. It would be a fateful year for the entire region. Protests broke out in Tunisia in December 2010 which led to régime collapse in early 2011 and the introduction of democracy to the country. Inspired by the success in Tunisia, protests spread to large areas of the Arab world. Egypt’s president was deposed in February 2011 by the military after massive popular pressure. Demonstrations began soon afterwards in Libya, which led to a civil war in which Denmark provided air support to the rebels as part of an international coalition. In other countries: Jordan, Morocco and Saudi Arabia, protests were met with promised reforms and ebbed out. In Bahrain demonstrators were beaten when the state received support from neighbouring countries. In Yemen the president stepped down but the country would eventually end up in a state of civil war.<br />Things would be different in Syria. Initial protests were dealt with in a tough manner by the military, which led to further protests that were met by tougher suppression by the régime. As violence spiralled, the first protests developed into a civil war in Iraq’s neighbouring country that would go on for years. Despite several attempts by the UN, it was not possible to gain the support of the Security Council for an international intervention in the civil war in Syria.<br />Like Iraq, Syria was divided across several different religious faction and was ruled by the official secular Ba’ath Party. Unlike Iraq, Syria was dominated by its Alawi minority. Alawi is a branch of Shia Islam, but Syria’s broader population was massively dominated by Sunni Muslims. Although the rebellion in Syria initially involved a number of different groups who had united as the secular Free Syrian Army, the rebellion would, over time, become dominated by various Sunni Islamist groups who enjoyed economic support from abroad and were joined by Islamists from other countries who wanted to fight in the civil war.<br />One of the rebel factions was based in the Iraqi branch of al-Qaeda, which had been one of the first and most enduring resistance groups after the fall of Saddam Hussein. Initially, Al-Qaeda in Iraq had been mainly composed of Islamists from other parts of the Islamic world who had arrived to fight the American occupation of Iraq. When it became clear that the Ba’ath régime in Iraq would never return to power, a number of former officers joined the group as a way of continuing the war against the coalition. After disagreements on religious doctrine and military strategy, parts of the Iraqi branch dealigned themselves from Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda’s leadership in 2006. Shortly afterwards, al-Qaeda in Iraq announced the creation of a new organisation called the Islamic State in Iraq (ISI).<br />During the civil war in Syria a new wave of foreign Islamists entered the country and many Sunni Muslims became radicalised after years of fighting against the régime. Meanwhile, ISI grew in strength and took advantage of the conflict in Syria, where they could operate to the same degree as in Iraq. They therefore changed their name in 2013 to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL. Unlike other Islamist terror organisations, ISIL’s focus was not so much on generating instability and toppling a government. ISIL was instead trying to conquer territory and form an extremist state.<br />By 2014, everyone was talking about them. ISIL was gaining ground in Iraq. They were able to conquer large parts of the town of Fallujah in January. In June they took Mosul, the third-largest town in Iraq, as the Iraqi army withdrew without offering much resistance. From Mosul, ISIL declared the foundation of a global caliphate under their leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Building on their success, ISIL would soon control a large swath of eastern Syria and north western Iraq. This was mostly thinly populated desert areas, but included several cities such as Fallujah, Mosul, and Tikrit in Iraq and towns like Raqqa and Palmyra in Syria. Condemned by the global community and Islamic religious leaders, a few extremist groups elsewhere pledged allegiance to ISIL. These included Boko Haram in Nigeria.</p>\n<p><em>Operation Inherent Resolve - Air Support and Training.</em> <br />Their success on the battlefield was not the only thing for which ISIL became notorious. They decided to remove all signs of pre-Islamic civilisation in the areas they had conquered.Sites of the most ancient Mesopotamian ruins were blown up or destroyed by other means. Mosul and the surrounding areas were home to some of the oldest Christian communities and the Yazidi minority. Both groups attempted to flee, as ISIL relentlessly executed prisoners, including the many prisoners they had taken from the Iraqi army when fighting to gain control of the region.<br />Almost 50,000 Yazidis had fled to Mount Sinjar when ISIL advanced and were trapped there in late summer while ISIL apparently waited for them to die from hunger and heat. On 7 August, US President Barack Obama therefore announced the first step in a return to Iraq by the USA. This involved an air bombardment of ISIL to protect the Yazidis and air drops of emergency aid for the many refugees. With air support from the US, forces from Iraqi Kurdistan forced ISIL to retreat, allowing them to rescue the many Yazidis who had been trapped on Mount Sinjar.<br />A new coalition was formed to fight ISIL. Participants included the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Jordan, Morocco, and Denmark. It was officially launched in October as Operation Inherent Resolve. Rather than to deploy ground troops, the goal of the operation was to defeat ISIL from the air. Participating countries sent a number of individuals to Iraq to advise and train its army for the battle ahead. Some countries did, however, deploy ground troops in Iraq to fight ISIL directly.<br />The Iraqi army was largely unsuccessful in 2014, being defeated or retreating from the ISIL offensive. The training missions were therefore very high priority. The many militias in Iraq were also brought together under a state-sponsored umbrella organisation called Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF). With international air support, a retrained army and the new PMF, Iraq was eventually able to launch a successful offensive against ISIL. <br />After a number of defeats, it looked in 2017 as though time was running out for ISIL. While being hit by air strikes by several international coalitions, ISIL was attacked in Syria by just about all of the many fractions in the civil war, and the regrouped Iraqi army and forces from the independent Kurdish territory sent it into retreat. ISIL was driven from Mosul during the summer, and lost its capital Raqqa in Syria in October.<br />On 9 December 2017, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared that the Islamic State had been definitively defeated in Iraq and that all its territory had been retaken. Remnants of ISIL have, however, been able to carry out isolated terrorist attacks, such as the suicide bombings in Baghdad in early 2018.</p>\n<p><em>A Future for Iraq?</em> <br />After the defeat of ISIL, it seems that Iraq may be heading towards a more stable future. Prime minister Haider al-Abadi and his government are generally viewed as more driven by compromise than their predecessors and have regained official control of the entire country. The bringing together of the many militias under PMF and putting them on the state payroll suggests that the state finally has the support of all significant armed groups within the country. If they can be integrated into the official army or as a form of home defence, one major threat to Iraq’s stability will have been avoided. It is quite possible that several of the militias that form PMF have loyalties elsewhere, such as individual parties, movements and even the theocracy in Iran, which has long been a supporter of several of the Shia Muslim militias.<br />One major challenge is the issue of the Kurds in the northern region of the country. Since Iraq was formed after the First World War, the Kurds have wanted their own independent state that would be able to unite with Kurdish minorities in neighbouring countries. The Kurds have been the victims of severe suppression, especially by Saddam Hussein who had no hesitation committing acts of genocide or using chemical weapons against them. Since 1991 the Kurds have effectively had self-governing status, which was formalised after the invasion in 2003. As a self-governing region, Kurdish forces are not part of PMF but were among the most effective in the war against Islamic State, and the Kurds were able to occupy a larger territory than previously, including the important oil fields near the town of Kirkuk. A 2017 referendum on independence revealed that 92% of Kurds wanted to have their own state. The question was raised once again, but Iraq’s central government in Baghdad was unwilling to enter negotiations. They therefore sent the army north and after a short engagement the Kurds withdrew from Kirkuk. Demonstrations in neighbouring countries in support of the Kurds were suppressed and any official declaration of independence would be met with hostility, not only by the government of Iraq, but by Turkey and Iran.<br />Corruption is still widespread in Iraq and various interests in the country are dissatisfied with the government. After the wars against Iran and Kuwait and the rebellions and sanctions of the 1990s, after Saddam Hussein’s divisive policies, the invasion of 2003 and the sectarian civil war, many Iraqis still feel a closer affiliation to their clan or religious community than they do the government as a whole. There is hope, however, that the united resistance against ISIL will serve as a unifier and the 2018 parliamentary elections proceeded in good order. If Iraq is able to generate stable economic development, a peaceful solution to the Kurdish issue and absorb PMF into the actual armed forces, it could transition from being one of the least stable and ungovernable regions in the world to becoming a functioning state once again. The period after the fall of Saddam Hussein has not been an easy time for Iraq and the country’s future remains uncertain.</p>"

It is home to countless peoples and tribes. Very few external powers have ever been able to seize control of this country. It is a land that is deeply characterised by the rise of Islam and the caliphates’ rule over the people and tribes of the steppes. It would later become an area of conflicting Russian and British interests, but achieved independence in 1919. The following 60 years would bring modernisation, but were also a time of increased rivalry between the Soviet Union and the USA. This was a time of coups d'etat, of weak leadership and disagreement between central and local structures, a time that would ultimately lead to a communist régime and intervention by the Soviet Union in 1979. The Mujahideen appeared and in 1988 the Soviet Union withdrew from an Afghanistan that had reached boiling point, as the various factions fought over power.<br />A new puritanical movement rose up; the Taliban, who would occupy Kabul and seize power in 1996. Al-Qaeda under the leadership of Osama bin Laden set up facilities in the country, from where a number of terrorist attacks were planned and coordinated. One such attack targeted the USA directly on 11 September 2001. A USA-led coalition attacked Al-Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. In 2002 the Afghan tribal council appointed a new government. This government would require massive amounts of international support.<br />From 2001/2002 onwards, names and notions like ISAF, Kabul, Helmand, Feyzabad, Chaghcharan, opium, the education of women and girls, women’s rights, the rebuilding of civic structures, the training of security forces, IEDs, the Green Zone, OMLT and many others would have a long-lasting impact on the thousands of Danes and others who were deployed to Afghanistan to perform numerous roles.<br />If you would like to learn more, then please read one of more of the following chapters. It is interesting reading indeed.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>HISTORY<br />At first glance Afghanistan may seem like a country far away from history’s great power centres. Its location, however, is at the crossroads where they all meet. Afghanistan lies right in the middle of the Silk Road, which was the main trading artery between China and Europe for millennia. This has made Afghanistan an important objective for Kings and Emperors for centuries. Its people, however, are strong-willed and difficult to govern. Rulers who were able to govern Afghanistan with any degree of success had to take their time, or actually live there.</p>\n<p><em>The melting pot of antiquity</em> <br />Afghanistan has always been an important crossroads for traders and rulers. Geologically, Blue Lapis Lazuli stone is found hardly anywhere other than northern Afghanistan, yet it has been found in jewellery and burial chambers in Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt.<br />During antiquity, what is now known as Afghanistan was part of the Persian Empire. Afghanistan’s links with Iran have been a common thread throughout it’s history. The Persian Shahanshah, King of Kings, ruled over large areas of Afghanistan as the easternmost area of his empire, an empire which stretched all the way to Greece at various points in history. The Persian Empire was not eternal, however, and was ultimately conquered by the young Alexander the Great during his campaign of conquest in the East. Alexander made it all the way to India before being forced to turn back. Before his campaign in India, Alexander had spent years in Afghanistan defeating local tribes and fortifying the hillsides with his loyal Greek followers, who remained in the area to maintain it under his authority.<br />Alexander died at a young age in 323 BC. As his empire collapsed and was parted out among his generals, the Greek troops remained in Afghanistan, founding the Kingdom of Bactria, the capital of which was modern-day Balkh in northern Afghanistan. Isolated from the Hellenic world by a reawoken Persian Empire, Bactria’s culture was an unusual hybrid, taking influences from its local population, Greek settlers, trading connections with China and from Buddhist and Hindu migrants who arrived from India. Over time, Bactria would collapse into smaller states. Nomads from the steppes of central Asia immigrated and became part of the Greco-Buddhist towns in the area.<br />This melting pot of cultures would endure for centuries thanks to the wealth from the Silk Road. It would carve out the world's largest statues of the Buddha in the hillsides of Bamiyan in central Afghanistan. This was not a united state, however. Rather, it was a number of smaller principalities and tribes who were, at different times, partially ruled from Persia, India or by the various steppe peoples. All three groups fought over power and control of what was then an area of great wealth, and over control of the mountain passes and trade roads that joined China, India and Persia; and thus the route to the Middle East and to Europe.</p>\n<p><em>The arrival of Islam</em> <br />During the seventh century, a new superpower would try to conquer Afghanistan. The caliphates that followed the death of the prophet Mohammed conquered Persia, whose final empire from antiquity collapsed after being defeated by the Arabs in 651AD. The first expeditions into Afghanistan by Muslims had already commenced a decade previously.<br />The legends of the Pashtun people narrate how their ancestral chieftain Quais travelled to Mecca during the time of Mohammed, converted to Islam and took the name Abdul Rashid. Quais then returned home, where he and his sons disseminated the new religion, forming the basis for the tribes that became the present day Pashtun. Quais does not appear in Arabic sources and converting the Pashtun or the rest of Afghanistan to Islam did not happen overnight. This process took hundreds of years.<br />At first glance, the Islamic expeditions into Afghanistan appear to have been a success. Towns like Herat and Kandahar were conquered, but as soon as the invading army departed the locals rebelled, denounced Islam and went back to their previous ways. Kabul and Peshawar continued to be ruled by Hindu princes for centuries, even though they did convert temporarily to Islam after their defeat, a conversion which only lasted until the Muslim army had departed. It was not until 1010 that all of modern Afghanistan fell under Islamic rule, with the exception of a single mountain valley in the East that was known for many years as Kafristan, which loosely translated means “the country of the infidels”. Converting this region to Islam took many centuries of persistence, as the population would return to its previous customs as soon as the invaders had departed. Kafiristan did not convert to Islam until the end of the 19th Century, when it was renamed Nouristan (which means “the land of light”), by which name it is still known today.</p>\n<p><em>About the people of the steppes and the Great Mughals</em> <br />Large areas of Afghanistan are dominated by the western Himalayas, from where melted ice forms the rivers that bring fertility to certain regions of the country. To the North, the mountains become great open plains, stretching throughout Central Asia, from China in the East to the Ukraine in the West. Typically, these areas have been dominated by equestrian peoples like the Turks and Mongols. Horses were a necessity of life for these peoples, who were constantly on the move in search of new grazing areas. The point at which the Afghan steppes end and other states begin has not always been entirely clear. People from the steppes have often occupied parts of Afghanistan, and vice versa. They have also immigrated in waves to the area at various points through history.<br />Genghis Khan was the greatest of the steppe people, and Afghanistan was part of the Mongol empire for many years. In terms of this history of Afghanistan, Genghis Khan was actually not the most important of the steppe warlords. Instead, this was Turkish-speaking Timur Lenk who, during the 14th Century, founded a kingdom whose capital city was Herat in western Afghanistan. From Herat, his successors governed a powerful state that included Persia, Pakistan and northern India, as well as large areas of steppe to the North.<br />Known as the Timurid Empire, it was ruled for centuries by the descendants of its founder, but would gradually lose control over the more remote areas. Babur, one of Timur’s heirs, had to reconquer Kabul at the start of the16th Century. He made Kabul the capital of his kingdom and soon became involved in Indian politics. From Kabul, he led an Afghan army through the Khyber Pass that connects Afghanistan with what is now Pakistan and India. Once there, he occupied Delhi. In English his realm became known as the Great Mughal (or Mogul) Empire.<br />The Great Mughals would, however, lose Herat and Kandahar in western and southern Afghanistan to a revived Persia, and Afghanistan would once again be divided between multiple states. Meanwhile, the Great Mughals had managed to annex most of India. Babur and his successors were responsible for impressive constructions like the Taj Mahal. It was during this period that the Danish colonies of Trankebar and Frederiksnagore in India were founded as trading stations by agreement with the Great Mughal's vassals.<br />The country that would eventually become present-day Afghanistan first appeared during the middle of the 18th Century. As the Great Mughal Empire was slowly undermined by structures like the British East Asia Company, Nadir Shah ruled a powerful Persian state and western Afghanistan. With many Pashtun tribal warriors in his army, Nadir Shah was able to conquer the whole of Afghanistan and even invaded India, where he plundered the Great Mughal’s capital city, Delhi. Nadir was assassinated upon his return to Iran and his empire was broken up. Ahmed Shad, the first king of the Durrani dynasty and leader of the Pashtun warriors, took power in 1747.<br />As time went on Ahmed Shah Durrani would conquer even greater areas of land and would rule an empire that was centred in Afghanistan but stretched into modern-day Iran, Usbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tadsjikistan, Pakistan and north western India. The Durrani Empire is considered the beginning of modern Afghanistan and Ahmed Shah is now celebrated as the country’s founder.</p>\n<p><em>The Great Game: Afghanistan between two superpowers</em><br />As generals and leaders, Ahmed Shah’s successors were not as effective as their ancestor and parts of Afghanistan would be lost over the years. The late 18th and early 19th centuries brought many years of instability, with attempted coups, rebellion and civil war. Various members of the Durrani clan, often brothers and cousins, warred against each other to occupy the throne and the title of Shah. Out of this anarchy rose the Barakzai dynasty, which originated in the same Pashtun tribe as the Durrani. Afghanistan was ruled by the Barakzais until 1978.<br />The first Barakzai ruler was Dost Muhammed, whose title was Emir of Kabul. No longer the empire that had been ruled by the Durrani, Afghanistan had, by the time he became ruler, become a small and unstable state that was part of a high-stakes political game that was being played by European powers. Russia had expanded into Siberia and was beginning to encroach upon Afghanistan from the North. By this time, India had also become part of the British Empire. Although the Great Moghal and other princes were the theoretical rulers of India, this was only because this suited British interests.<br />The British feared that Russian influence in Afghanistan could cause the British control of India to come under threat. A British-Indian army was therefore mustered to place the previously deposed Shah Shuja on the throne, which would ensure that Afghanistan had no close links to Russia. The First Anglo-Afghan War began in 1839 and initially went well for the British. They won battles, conquered towns, imprisoned Dost Muhammed and put Shah Shuja in Kabul. But what had happened to others, the same would happen to the British. After their army had withdrawn and only a small garrison had been left behind, rebellion broke out. Despite the promise of free passage if they withdrew, and of a force of 4,500 soldiers, only a few survivors made it back through the Khyber Pass to British territory. A new British-Indian force made an attempt to invade but Shah Shuja had been assassinated. The war did not end until 1842, when Dost Muhammed was released and set pack on the throne after he pledged goodwill to Great Britain.<br />There was another British invasion of Afghanistan in 1878, when Emir Sher Ali received Russian diplomats but denied the presence of a permanent British representation in Kabul. Once again, the British won quick victories and the signature of a peace treaty in 1879, this time with Sher Ali’s son after his father had died. A British ambassador was then posted to Afghanistan. But once again there was rebellion and the ambassador and his guards were murdered. The war ended two years later, when Sher Ali’s nephew, Abdur Rahman, took the rest of the country with his own Afghan army and agreed to adopt a foreign affairs policy that was compatible with the interests of the British administration in India.<br />Afghanistan has always had fluid borders and the ability to adapt to whoever was able to enforce authority, provided that they had the loyalty of the local tribes. This “system” did not suit the British “Raj” in India, who favoured a permanent demarcation of the border. Fortunately, Abdur Rahman was not just willing to collaborate with the British, but became known as the “Iron Emir” as he wiped out all resistance while creating an effective central power base that was able to control the entire country, making it possible to establish a permanent border demarcation.<br />The new border was named “the Durand Line” after the English diplomat who had negotiated on behalf of the British administration in India. Although this agreement was signed by Durand and Abdur Rahman, the border has been a matter of conflict ever since. It traverses the inaccessible mountains of the Hindu Kush, which means that it cuts through the Pashtun tribes, who have had traditionally equally close links to towns and people both north and south of the Durand Line.<br />Afghanistan remained neutral throughout the First World War, but Amanullah Khan inherited the throne in 1919. Because of British war fatigue and the post-war demobilisation of the Indian army, Amanullah saw an opportunity. Like the Great Moghals and Durranis before him, he led an army through the Khyber Pass and invaded India. He was also able to persuade many Pashtun from the southern side of the Durand Line to rebel and join him.<br />The Third Anglo-Afghan War would proceed somewhat differently to its two predecessors. The British-Indian army pushed Amanullah’s forces back and a Royal Air Force bombing campaign was very successful in scattering an army that was comprised of rebel tribesmen. The British had learned some lessons from the previous war, however. There was no prospect that they would try to reoccupy Afghanistan. As Russia collapsed to revolution and civil war, Afghanistan no longer had strategic importance as a buffer state. A peace treaty was signed, in which Afghanistan gained full independence and control over its own foreign affairs policy. As the British in India faced a years-long battle to defeat the Pashtun tribes south of the Durand Line, Amanullah returned to an independent Afghanistan to establish a modern state.</p>"

Over the following 60 years its various monarchs considered it important to modernise the country, with all the consequences that would entail. Factions within the country saw this process of modernisation gradually eroding their power or status and opposed it, as the rest of the world headed into the Second World War and the subsequent Cold War. “The Great Game” that was played by Russia and Great Britain in Central Asia during the 19th Century would eventually be replaced by rivalries between the USA and the Soviet Union. This would have serious consequences for Afghanistan.</p>\n<p><em>Modernisation among superpowers</em> <br />After the Third Anglo-Afghan War, Amanullah decided that it was time to modernise his kingdom. Electricity and more advanced infrastructures were introduced, but the process of modernisation was not only in the form of technology. All of Afghan society was to be restructured as a Western-style nation state, taking strong inspiration from the processes that Mustafa Kemal Atutürk had been introducing in Turkey during this period. Amanullah had himself crowned using the Persian title of Padshah (Great King), instead of Emir like his predecessors. He formulated Afghanistan’s first constitution and gave up absolute monarchy in favour of a constitutional one. Afghanistan's population would no longer be considered subjects or tribal people, but citizens of a modern state, wearing Western attire and receiving a secular education. The first steps towards the liberation of women would be taken too, with the abolition of laws that required women’s faces to be covered. <br />The reforms process was introduced to the population in 1924 at a Loya Jirga, a traditional tribal council that had been used previously to unite the nation’s tribes to swear allegiance to a new king. Just as the absolute monarchy had been legitimised by Islamic rules, Amnunallah also used religious arguments to support the new state and the new form of government. New state-controlled madrasas (religious schools) would be set up to assure governmental control of the religious elite and of subjects that were not related to religion.<br />Not everyone was happy about the process of modernisation and, as they saw their power eroded, religious leaders began to rebel. Amanullah was deposed in 1929 and was replaced on the throne by a Tadsjik rebel, who would himself be deposed soon afterwards by a coalition of Pashtun tribes, who crowned one of Amanullah’s relatives, Nadir Shah, after another Loya Jirga. A new constitution in 1931 secured the power of religious leaders in the Jamiat al-Ulema, the council of the wise, who would check that all new legislation was in accordance with religious requirements.<br />Nadir Shah would be assassinated just two years later. His son, Zahir Shah, then became king. Appointing relatives as prime ministers one after the other, he ruled Afghanistan through a long period of stability. Especially after the Second World War, Afghan development and economy would progress with rapid industrialisation, statutory schooling for all (even though this would seldom be the case in rural areas) and increased numbers of women in employment and at university. Zahir and his advisors were more cautious than Amanullah in the speed at which they introduced new reforms. Reforms would initially be rolled out in Kabul, from where they would spread on a gradual basis, while ensuring that taxes and military conscription were only increased at a rate to which even the most conservative tribes would be able to grow accustomed.<br />When the British left the region and the colonies became independent states in 1947, the Durand Line continued as the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The area on the Pakistani side of the border was named North-West Frontier Province (NWFP). Here, the Pashtun tribal areas would often act as if they were to all intents and purposes independent. At times this would lead to tensions, as Afghan governments thought that this region should be reunited with Afghanistan as a united homeland for the Pashtun.<br />Formally, Afghanistan was part of the Non-Aligned Movement and was thus aligned with neither side during the Cold War. Instead, the Afghan administration tried to play the two superpowers against one another. The northern border with the Soviet Union meant that the bulk of development aid that was received by Afghanistan initially came from the Soviets, who would soon become Afghanistan’s largest trading partner. The USA increased investment in Afghanistan in order to prevent it from becoming fully integrated within the Soviet sphere Afghanistan’s largest motorway (a circular highway connecting most towns) was built half by Soviet engineers and half using American funding.</p>\n<p><em>The coup d’état and communism</em> <br />Slowly, the process of modernisation and development would produce a new middle class. Even though illiteracy remained widespread and most of the population were subsistence farmers, a growing number of intellectuals would graduate from Kabul University. These would become the army’s professional officers, the middle managers of Afghanistan’s flourishing industry and bureaucrats within its expanding administration. Everyone had new ideas about how the country should be governed and wanted to influence its administration.<br />There were multiple attempts to create a democratic system with an elected parliament and free press. 1949 onwards was a relatively liberal period until King Zahir’s cousin, Daud Khan, was appointed prime minister and abolished the democratic experiment in 1953. Daud Khan would have to step down as prime minister in 1964, after a new constitution was introduced at a Loya Jirga. Even though Afghanistan now had an elected parliament, Zahir would still appoint the government and set the tone. Parliament was able to debate as much as it liked, but had no practical power and political parties remained illegal.<br />As time went on, the politically active class (who were mainly in Kabul) would split into two highly opposed factions: a revolutionary communist left wing and a conservative Islamic right. Disagreements were particularly vehement at the universities and clashes between the two factions were far from unusual.<br />Daud Khan was unhappy about being sidelined and began to seek support from communist elements within the People’s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA). With a political scene in a state of chaos, a famine that had been caused by drought and Zahir Shah out of the country, Daud executed a coup, abolished the monarchy and established a republic with himself as president. At first glance this appeared to be a radical break with the past, but as the cousin of the king, Daud was actually only continuing the monarchy under the Barakzai dynasty. The only thing that was really new was the title of the head of state and that the factions that supported him were neither tribal leaders nor traditional Islamic savants.<br />It became quickly apparent that President Daud was no communist, even though he had received support from PDPA during the coup. He was instead an authoritarian who tried to eliminate all rivals. One attempted rebellion by the new Islamic movement was easily defeated in 1975 as it had no popular support. As Daud tried to break with socialist policy and purge PDPA members, the party triggered an ad-hoc coup to get rid of him, led by a number of officers with left-wing sympathies. Daud was killed and PDPA took power. This much was true... in Kabul.</p>\n<p>T<em>he Soviet Union - an invited guest becomes an invader</em> <br />The communists in PDPA may well have toppled Daud and formally taken power in Afghanistan, but they continued to face a number of problems. Having a communist party in control was a radical change in government style and legitimacy instead of monarchy or Daud’s presidency. It was also the first time in 150 years that the Barakzai clan was not in control of the country. PDPA may well have had the support of the educated urban middle classes, but most of the population found the new government distant and alien. <br />PDPA had also been split into two rival factions since 1967: the Khalq (or “the masses”) and Parcham (which means “banner”). The two groups were united by party and ideology, but had very different ideas about methodology and leadership. Although they had, during the coup, agreed upon a joint government that would be led by President Taraki, the Khalq began to purge Parcham leaders from positions of authority by posting them overseas as ambassadors, thus ensuring that they were without influence at home.<br />PDPA intended to revolutionise society. Not only had they changed land ownership and written off peasants’ debts, but a number of laws had been passed that were intended to establish new social norms. This included fundamental change to gender roles and inheritance law, two areas that were completely central to the self-perception of large numbers of Afghans, both in terms of religion and ethnic identity. Before long the new communist régime would face broad popular rebellion.<br />The communist administration asked the Soviet Union for help to put down the rebellion. Aid was sent, initially in the form of military hardware and advisors. The situation boiled over when Hafizullah Amin, the leader of Khalq, arrested and murdered President Taraki to seize power for himself. Tensions increased between Moscow and Kabul and a large Soviet force crossed the border between the two countries on 27 December 1979. According to the Soviet Union, this was in support of their ally and was completely legitimised by the numerous requests for an intervention of this type. Hafizullah Amin was killed. His government was replaced with figures who were more Soviet-friendly and Babrak Karmal, one of the leaders of the Parcham faction, was inserted as president.<br />Many Afghan army units deserted and what Moscow had intended to be a quick reassertion of law and order in a neighbouring country transitioned into a war that would last for years. Instead of stabilising Afghanistan, it became a holy war against a hostile invasion.<br />Although the modern Afghan Islamists came from the same towns and universities as the Communists, they quickly found themselves at the forefront of the rebellion in the country. Not only were they the only movement with a cohesive ideology, but they were also a party that had already attempted armed rebellion. They were also the only faction to possess the necessary organisational capacity. After the failed revolution in 1975, many had become exiles in Pakistan. They received plenty of support from abroad, provided exclusively by the Pakistani Intelligence Agency ISI. Collectively, the scattered groups of rebels became known as the Mujahideen (singular, Mujahid) - those fighting jihad, or holy war. These fighters were as alien to Afghanistan’s rural population as the Communists, but they spoke a familiar language and had the necessary means to fight the Soviet forces for the following decade.</p>"

Controlling the area requires an understanding of its geography. Throughout their history, the Afghans have therefore been skilled at exploiting the mountainous terrain and turning hostile powers against one another to their own advantage.</p>\n<p><em>About mountains, desert and rivers.</em> <br />Afghanistan is split into three parts: inaccessible mountains, open steppes and desert, and the fertile river valleys. The western Himalayas, known as the Hindu Kush, dominate eastern and central Afghanistan but also branch off in all directions. They are divided into smaller groups, including the Spin Ghar mountains which became famous in 2001 when it was believed that Al-Qaeda had gone into hiding in the Tora Bora cave complex. Throughout history the mountains have always been the most difficult part of the country to govern. Apart from making payments to the tribes that controlled the most important mountain passes, and the Khyber Pass in particular, many kingdoms and governments have chosen to leave the mountains and their residents in peace. There was no permanent border between Afghanistan and its neighbours to the south-west until the Durand Line was established in 1893.<br />The north, west and south are generally more open. The steppes to the north continue almost endlessly, continuing through neighbouring Usbekistan, Tadsjikistan and Turkmenistan. They have been home to various nomadic peoples, sometimes subject to Afghan rules and sometimes these peoples conquered Afghanistan. Afghanistan is therefore home to large minority populations who are descended from its neighbours and the various steppe peoples who immigrated or conquered their way into the country. Nowadays many of them are farmers and large areas of steppe land in northern Afghanistan are used to grow crops. To the south and west the steppes become more and more arid, before finally turning into desert. Traditionally, only the toughest tribes have been able to exist here, and even these tribes have not lived there on a permanent basis.<br />The entirety of Afghanistan is traversed and irrigated by a number of rivers of various sizes, each with a source in the melted glacial ice from the peaks of the Himalayas. They often cut through the mountains, creating fertile valleys and highland plains, where towns like Kabul have been built. The rivers flow through even the most arid areas of desert, creating lines of greenery. “The Green Zone” along the Helmand river was familiar territory to the Danish troops who were stationed in the area. Through history, the river valleys and the towns that depend on them have been the key to Afghanistan. Kandahar, Herat, Kabul and many other towns are often the centres that foreign powers have tried to conquer, and from where power was centralised for the local states.</p>\n<p><em>Afghanistan - a country of many peoples</em> <br />Many different peoples live in Afghanistan. The most important common denominator in addition to an Afghan passport is that all of them are Muslim, be they Sunni, Shia or one of the various Sufi faiths. The two most common languages are Pashto and Dari (a Farsi dialect) but numerous other languages are spoken there. Because of unrest, inaccessible terrain and a frequently weak central power structures, a full population census has never been carried out in Afghanistan. An estimated 35 million people live in Afghanistan but this figure, as well as figures pertaining to the size of the various population groups, are ultimately impossible to confirm.<br />The Pashtun are the largest and most important group, comprising about 40% of the population and have governed the country for most of the last four centuries. They are the majority population in the south and east and have a presence in all large towns, where they are also often the largest group. The Durand Line crosses right through the Pashtun heartland and more Pashtun live in Pakistan than in Afghanistan. They are a minority population in Pakistan, however. Pashtun are normally defined according to three parameters: speaking Pashto, being descended from a Pashtun founding father (thus belonging to one of the clans) and following Pashtunwali, which is a kind of tribal law or code of honour. Pashtunwali places great importance on honour and reputation, which are typically gauged on the basis of courage and hospitality. A man’s honour also depends on the conduct of the women in his family. There are many people in larger towns who identify as Pashtun, even though they only speak Dari, are not members of a clan and do not follow Pashtunwali. Ethnicity is always a fluid consideration.<br />The next-largest group is the Tadsjiks, who represent about a quarter of Afghanistan's population. As their name suggests, they are related to the population of neighbouring Tadsjikistan where, paradoxically, fewer Tadsjiks reside than in Afghanistan. They typically live close to the border in the north east, and in the towns where they have historically been the majority population in many places. Their language is Dari. Because Dari is the traditional language of the administration and the Tadsjiks were town-dwellers, they have occupied important roles as traders, bureaucrats and scribes, though they have seldom occupied the positions of real power.<br />The Hazara people are the third-largest group, representing 10-15% of the population. The Hazara are Shia Muslims and mainly live in the central highlands as mountain farmers in an area known as Hazarajat. Here, they were all but independent until Abdur Rahman ,the Iron Emir, conquered the area towards the end of the 19th Century. Although they speak Dari, they are (according to their own histories) descended from Genghis Khan and his Mongolian horse tribes and often viewed with condescension by other Afghan tribes because of their race and religion.<br />About 10% of Afghans are Usbeks and about 5% are Turkmenians. Both groups are Turkish-speaking Sunni Muslims with close links to neighbouring Usbekistan and Turkmenistan. They live near the borders in the north and north west and are descended from the equestrian tribes who have invaded, plundered and conquered Afghanistan over the years. Usbeks and Turkmenians also comprise the majority of the nomads who still have a presence in the country.<br />The Chahir Aimaq are another Turkish-speaking nomadic people who live north and east of Herat. They differ from the Usbeks and Turmkenians by being clearly divided into four different tribes and represent less than 5% of Afghanistan’s population. There are also a number of smaller groups. The Nurustani and Pashai are two such groups and live in the mountains to the East. The Quizbash are a third group. They are Shia by faith but are traditionally accepted as part of Kabul’s elite. The Baluch live in the southernmost desert, have their own language and are closely related to Baluch in Iran and Pakistan. Finally, Afghanistan has historically been home to minority Arabs, Sikhs, Hindus and even a Jewish community. Most of these groups have fled the country, however, as a result of the constant warfare since the 1970s.</p>\n<p><em>Foreign powers.</em> <br />Since their independence in 1947 there has been a constant struggle between Pakistan and India about where the border between the two countries should lie. Because Afghanistan has its own border dispute with Pakistan, the Afghans have collaborated with India on occasion, in the hope of a reassessment of where border boundaries should lie. The two superpowers during this period were the Soviet Union and the USA, who Afghanistan also tried to play off against each other. As a monarchy it was very successful in this regard until a Communist government aligned Afghanistan too closely with the Soviet Union, who intervened in 1979 because of unrest in the country. <br />During the Cold War the USA feared that the invasion of Afghanistan was a Soviet attempt to continue to expand southwards towards the Indian Ocean. No matter what the Russians’ true objective was, Afghanistan was an opportunity to inflict a defeat on their rival. Large sums of money and, not least, advanced technological weaponry was sent through Pakistan to aid the rebels. Especially after 1986 the Afghans received large quantities of hardware (including Stinger missiles) for use in the fight against the Soviet occupying forces.<br />The Saudi viewpoint was that an atheist communist state had invaded an Islamic nation. This was at a time when the Saudis themselves were facing internal pressure from extremist factions who did not consider the kingdom to be sufficiently Islamic. Money from oil began to flow in and the extremists were able to fight a holy war far from home, where they posed no threat to the Saudi king. Many Saudis and other Arabs travelled to Pakistan to join the Afghan resistance as volunteers. The most famous of these was Osama bin Laden, who used this network of volunteers as the base for the creation of al-Qaeda.<br />General Zia ul-Haq had seized power in Pakistan through a military coup. To ensure popular support he stood at the forefront of an Islamisation process within Pakistan. When he and his ISI intelligence agency became the intermediary for sending money, volunteers and hardware to Afghan rebels, he therefore favoured the Islamic factions. This allowed him to show the people of his country that he was a good Muslim, the Americans that he was anti-communist and, perhaps at some time in the future, an Afghan government would come to rely on him and permit the movement of the Durand Line to a position that favoured Pakistan.<br />The Mujahideen would muster at bases in Pakistan, where they would be equipped and trained before continuing on to Afghanistan to fight against the Soviet Union. The many refugees from the war who now lived in Pakistani towns like Quetta and Peshawar were an obvious source of recruits. Many were also schooled at Saudi-sponsored Islamic madrasa schools, which were often the only education option available to refugees. Young men would be radicalised and encouraged to join the Mujahideen. Local rebel groups inside Afghanistan also felt the need to align themselves with one of the Islamist groups in order to receive a share of the international aid.</p>\n<p><em>Civil war and collapse</em> <br />As time went on, it became obvious to Moscow that the war in Afghanistan was unwinnable. It has often been called “The Soviet Vietnam” because of terrible losses during a tough guerilla campaign. This happened at the same time as a new Soviet leader came to power; Mikhail Gorbachev, who was far more interested in domestic reforms than military campaigns abroad. A treaty was negotiated in 1988 that led to the withdrawal of the last remaining Soviet forces from Afghanistan in the spring of 1989.<br />The Communist régime in Afghanistan managed to survive for another couple of years, partly because it still received large amounts of economic aid. This aid evaporated with the fall of the Soviet Union and the Communist régime fell apart in April 1992. The resistance had no overall leadership, however, and none of the various Mujahideen groups were strong enough to dominate the others. The years that followed were characterised by lawlessness and civil war between various warlords, each of whom wanted to control the country.<br />Where the conflict had previously been limited to rural areas it now spread to the towns. Kabul was thoroughly devastated and represented the prize that everybody was trying to win.</p>"

The various rebel factions, who had fought against the Communists more or less as a unified force, would be able to topple the Communist régime in the years that followed. The rebels were, however, unable to agree about who should govern Afghanistan afterwards. And as the Cold War came to an end, the global superpowers were no longer interested in Afghanistan. It would collapse during the 1990s and be divided up between various warlords, who had now started fighting each other. A new puritanical movement arose in refugee camps in the Pashtun heartland, one that wanted to return order to Afghanistan.</p>\n<p><em>Communists, warlords and chaos</em>. <br />After the Soviet Union had recalled its troops, the Communist régime in Afghanistan was able to remain in power under the leadership of President Najibullah, even though many people anticipated that it would collapse. The various rebel factions attempted to occupy larger towns, but had no unified command structure or combat experience other than guerilla warfare in inaccessible areas. Taking a fortified town was a completely different type of mission and elements of the Afghan military remained loyal to the régime.<br />Many local rebel groups were also willing to fight as paid militias on behalf of Najibullah. Najibullah’s survival was still dependent on Russia, however. Even though the Soviets had withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan, he continued to receive large amounts of funding and materials from Moscow. When the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991, he lost the support of a superpower and and the funding to pay the militias dried up. Najibullah's régime was toppled the following April.<br />The militias were autonomous once again and the remnants of the régime would more often than not join them. Attempts were made to broker an agreement and the leaders of the various factions who had organised the ongoing conflict gathered in Peshawar, were they were able establish a provisional government that united the largest factions. The party leaders in Peshawar were distanced from the Mujahideen leaders who had fought the war in Afghanistan, however, and they saw this as their opportunity to take control or lose everything that they had built.<br />The provisional government quickly collapsed. President Rabbani and Prime Minister Hekmatyar were both politicians who had sat out the war from Pakistan. Both were supported by their own Mujahideen and militias and soon ended up warring against each other over control of Kabul. Meanwhile, the last vestiges of authority in the country collapsed and forces that had previously had a formal loyalty to one or other faction took affair autonomously over their own local communities. The various warlords tried to defeat each other, or formed alliances with former enemies to gain any necessary advantage. None of them were able to unite the country, however and the superpowers were no longer interested. Only Pakistan continued to have a commitment, supporting Hekmatyar but unable to secure power on his behalf when Iran supplied the Rabbani faction with armaments.<br />Accordingly, Afghanistan continued over the years that followed to be deadlocked in a bloody civil war in which local warlords each ruled over their own districts with an iron fist, while continuing to war against each other. They became wealthy through plunder and by charging taxes and tolls on all traffic through their territories, while being free to murder, rape and otherwise suppress their local populations at their whim.</p>\n<p><em>Taliban: A Pashtun student movement</em>. <br />It was out of all this chaos that the Taliban would rise. Countless numbers of Afghans lived in refugee camps in Pakistan, where many young men had been born or grown up since the days of the Soviet Union's occupation of Afghanistan. Their only point of reference was stories about their homeland and the quasi-mythical Mujahideen who were courageously fighting a jihad to defend Islam against the atheists from the Soviet Union. Many of these refugees had, as children, only received one kind of schooling in the underfunded camps, at the Islamic madrasa schools, which were often funded by Saudi Arabia and where they were taught a very puritanical version of Islam.<br />The heroes of the Mujahideen had now become the warlords who raped, pillaged and destroyed their own homeland with their constant infighting. The disillusioned young men from the refugee camps therefore united around a movement, the core membership of which was comprised of Pashto-speaking refugees who had studied at the madrasas. They gave themselves a simple name, “the Students. Or in Pashto, Taliban.<br />The original roots and formation of the Taliban have almost mythological status. It is very hard to discern what is fact and what is fiction What is known is that the movement first saw light (and perhaps was founded) as an actual organisation in 1994, in a number of actions in and near to Kandahar. A one-eyed veteran of the war against the Soviet Union, known as Mullah Omar, ran a small madrasa in the desert in the southern region of the Pashtun territories. Like many others, he was horrified by the way that the Mujahideen had wasted the potential of their victory over the Soviet Union because of their infighting. When two young girls were kidnapped and raped by a local warlord, Mullah Omar assembled a dozen volunteers. Despite being poorly armed, they stormed the warlord’s home, liberated the girls and hung the warlord from the gun of his own tank.<br />This became a form of branding for Mullah Omar and the Taliban. Many warlords and militia commanders would end up dead. By carrying out actions like these and reopening trade routes in the areas where they had killed the local warlords, the Taliban quickly found popularity as a party of “law and order”. For many Afghans, the Taliban’s promise of peace and stability weighed far heavier than their radical interpretation of Islam.<br />By the end of 1994 they had taken Kandahar, from where they governed most of the Pashtun territories in Afghanistan. There was a flood of volunteers, many of whom were young men from the refugee camps. Many local Pashtun militiamen also left their militias to join the Taliban. After Hekmatyar’s previous failed attempts to occupy Kabul and govern the country, Pakistan decided to change tactics and began supporting the Taliban, who benefited from Pakistani arms and military advisors.<br />The civil war continued, even though the Taliban had begun to get involved. With an enormous basis for recruitment in the refugee camps, support from Pakistan and fighters with the conviction of their faith, they made massive progress and took town after town over the years that followed. They were often welcomed as heroes bringing a long-awaited peace, but it would not be long before rumours began to circulate about how the Taliban’s peace was administered. The difference was particularly noticeable in areas outside the Pashtun region, where the population was more ethnically diverse, where the common language was Dari and where there was a more international outlook. Despite tough resistance, the Taliban were able to gain control of most of Afghanistan. The remaining Mujahideen and warlords united in the Northern Alliance and remained in control of a few regions which the Taliban would never be able to occupy.</p>\n<p><em>The Taliban régime</em> <br />When Kabul was taken in September 1996, it seemed that the Taliban had won and that they had managed to succeed where the Mujahideen and the warlords had failed. They ruled most of the country and declared the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as a united Islamic state. Only in the northern regions of Afghanistan were the remaining warlords able to continue their resistance against the Taliban fighters.<br />The Taliban régime introduced a number of reforms and laws that not only reversed the process of modernisation and women’s rights that previous Communist régime and the monarchy had tried to implement, but went a lot further. To the rest of the world, the Burka became a symbol of Afghanistan, when Afghan women were forced to wear them. Men were also required by law to grow a beard that was at least the length of a clenched fist on their chins. Banned books were burned and music, television and photography were forbidden. Traditional play activities for children such as kite flying and pigeon racing were also impacted. Other religions were no longer tolerated and many historic treasures were destroyed. The most famous of these were the world’s largest statues of the Buddha, two statues carved into the hillside at Bamiyan, which were blown up despite attempts by leading Islamic scholars from all over the world to convince the Taliban to preserve them. <br />The legal system was based on an extreme interpretation of Sharia, with a strong dose of Pashtunwali, the code of honour of the Pashtun tribes. Penalties such as stoning, chopping off hands and other similar punishments became standard practice in Afghanistan for the first time in centuries. Only the most radical Pashtun elements in the Taliban movement found this satisfactory. Most people found this system repugnant and repressive. Members of other ethnic groups viewed this as the extreme code of the Pashtun, yet even many Pashtun; and particularly town dwellers, were also hostile to this system in a variety of ways. Many minorities experienced persecution, most notably the Shia Muslim Hazar people, who were viewed as heretics by the puritanical Sunni Muslims of the Taliban.<br />Internationally, the Taliban régime was only recognised by Pakistan, Saudi-Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It was never given a seat at the UN. It was instead highly criticised and sanctioned by the international community, notably because of the régime’s human rights violations and its exploitation of the illegal production and trafficking of opium as a source of state funding.<br />During the war against the Soviet Union, Afghanistan’s Mujahideen had accepted many volunteers from elsewhere in the Islamic world who wanted to take part in the fighting. From this base of volunteers sprang the al-Qaeda network, led by Osama bin Laden, who declared a worldwide jihad against the West. Few Afghans, Taliban or otherwise, took part in al-Qaeda operations but the régime did allow them to use Afghanistan as their base, as they had on occasion for other Islamic groups from other countries.<br />After al-Qaeda members set off two bombs at American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, causing over 200 deaths, the international community began to take the threat of al-Qaeda and its bases in Afghanistan a lot more seriously. Even after the Americans retaliated by launching a cruise missile attack on al-Qaeda's camps in Afghanistan, Mullah Omar and the Taliban leadership refused to expel Osama bin Laden for international prosecution. Their response was that hospitality is an extremely important aspect of Pashtunwali and that a guest should enjoy the protection of their host, no matter what. Their unshakeable resolve to allow bin Laden and al-Qaeda to operate with impunity from Afghanistan would lead to the fall of the Taliban a few years later, after al-Qaeda made its biggest attack on the USA in 2001.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>AFTER 11 SEPTEMBER<br />The Taliban régime would not be in power in Afghanistan for many years. Only five years after the Taliban took Kabul, al-Qaeda carried out the biggest terrorist attack the world had ever seen on 11 September 2001. The attack had been orchestrated at camps in Afghanistan. A US-led international coalition in which Denmark took part entered Afghanistan and toppled the Taliban régime. Removing the régime was only the first step, however. Although the Taliban was almost eliminated as an organisation after its defeat, its remnants continued to fight a drawn-out guerilla war against the new Afghan government and international forces in the country.</p>\n<p><em>The 11 September attacks</em> <br />Four passenger planes were hijacked in US airspace on 11 September 2001. Two of them flew into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, the two tallest in New York and an international symbol of free trade and America. One hit the Pentagon, headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense. The fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania when passengers had subdued the hijackers. The plane was believed to be headed for the White House or another target in Washington D.C. These attacks took the lives of nearly 3,000 people and shook Americans and the international community. The attacks were masterminded from bases in Afghanistan by the international terrorist organisation Al-Qaeda, led by Osama bin Laden. Soon afterwards US President George W. Bush declared an international war on terror. The goal of this war was to defeat Al-Qaeda and similar terrorist groups and to punish states that supported them or allowed them to operate in their territories – primarily Afghanistan, where the 9/11 attacks had been planned.<br />The UN Security Council convened on multiple occasions during September and unanimously voted to adopt Resolutions 1368 and 1373 (2001). The resolutions were a confirmation that the UN considered this action to be an attack on the US and a threat to international peace and security. They recognised the right of the US and its allies to independent and collective self defence and encouraged all UN member states to cooperate in bringing the culprits to justice and to oppose all organisations with links to international terrorism. NATO member states also held a summit to activate Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, which is also known as the “Musketeer oath”, as an attack on one member state is considered an attack on all member states.<br />A number of initiatives were set in motion, including allowing intelligence agencies to operate at higher intensity and at greater levels of mutual collaboration. The large-scale NATO Operation Active Endeavour commenced patrols in the Mediterranean. Danish ships also took part in this operation at various times. One single demand was presented to the Taliban régime - that it should hand over Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda. As before, Mullah Omar refused, referring to the Pashtunwali code of hospitality. He did concede that if it could be proven that bin Laden had indeed planned the attacks, then he had himself breached this code and could justifiably expelled. The Americans dismissed this as delaying tactics. Meanwhile, Mullah Omar issued a reminder of Afghanistan’s status as the graveyard of empires. According to the Taliban, the Americans would suffer the same fate as the Russians and British who had preceded them.</p>\n<p>O<em>peration Enduring Freedom and The New Afghanistan.</em> <br />The USA refused to be intimidated by the Mullah’s threats. On 7 October 2001, American and British aircraft commenced a series of air attacks against Taliban positions in Afghanistan, in coordination with an offensive by the Northern Alliance. These would be followed up by special forces. Already on 19 October, the first couple of hundred American troops arrived from bases in Usbekistan, followed by British special forces the following week.<br />Mullah Omar had promised that the graveyard of empires would also stop the Americans, but just ten weeks after the first attack, the Taliban was in full retreat throughout Afghanistan. Their first defeats came in the North and West, where they had never consolidated their power. In these areas the local Usbeks and Tadsjiks were overjoyed by the arrival of the Northern Alliance. Kabul was liberated on 13 November, with virtually no Taliban resistance. The Taliban had withdrawn from the town, hoping to regroup in their Pashtun-dominated core territories in the South and East. Pashtun clan leaders saw this, however, as an opportunity to take back their traditional power. The Taliban were driven out of Kandahar, their most important town, by local Pashtun tribes led by Hamid Karzai. Mullah Omar and the remnants of the Taliban fled to the mountains to the East and crossed the border to Pakistan.<br />This time, the Afghans did not rise up to drive the foreign troops out of their country, as many had otherwise expected. After constant wars and instability since the 1970s, most Afghans wanted Afghanistan to be a peaceful country that could make economic progress and hoped that the Americans would be able to bring this about. Meanwhile, huge numbers of refugees and their children returned from neighbouring countries.<br />The UN then organised a major conference in the German city of Bonn in December, which was attended by prominent leaders from the various Afghan factions. It seemed at the beginning of the conference that ageing ex-king Zahir Shah, who had lived as an exile since the 1973 coup, had the greatest amount of support. The result, however, was that Pashtun clan leader Hamid Karzai was appointed the leader of Afghanistan’s provisional administration, alongside a number of ministers who would govern until a more permanent solution could be implemented. Karzai is a descendant of Ahmed Shah Durrani, the founder of Afghanistan in the 18th Century.<br />While the conference was proceeding in Bonn, discussions were also underway about the planning of the first Danish contribution. The newly-elected Danish Prime Minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen, was absolutely determined to provide a Danish contribution to support the Americans and the British, as soon as possible. Parliamentary proposal B37 was given an emergency reading and was put forward, discussed and adopted by a broad majority in the Danish Parliament on 13 and 14 December. The Danish Parliament hereby consented to Denmark’s provision of special forces, a C-130 Hercules transport aircraft and four F-16 fighter aircraft to the operation in Afghanistan.<br />The first Danish Jaeger troops arrived in Kandahar just a week later, on 21 December. This was an advance unit that would perform reconnaissance and make preparations for the remainder of the force. The Hercules they flew in on was already operating the following day, flying transport missions for the Americans. The rest of the force arrived in January and was comprised of approx. 100 Danish Jaeger soldiers and men from the Frogmen Corps. They took part in a number of missions in collaboration with the American forces, including Operation Anaconda in the Shahi-Kot mountains, which would be the final actual battle against the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. After this engagement, most of these groups had fled to the Pashtun tribal regions in north-west Pakistan.<br />Now that the Taliban had been driven out, a national Loya Jirga was held in June 2002. A Loya Jirga is a traditional tribal council that, throughout Afghan history, has legitimised important decisions or sitting governments. It adopted what had been agreed at the conference in Bonn and a new transitional government was appointed to prepare a constitution and democratic elections, headed by Hamid Karzai.</p>\n<p><em>ISAF, NATO and Denmark in Afghanistan.</em> <br />Soon after the conference in Bonn, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1386 on 20 December 2001. This set out the framework for an international military force that would support the provisional government, led by Hamid Karzai. The UN wanted to combine a large-scale force with a legal mandate under international law that would be able to guarantee security during the building of local Afghan military and police forces. This was given the name “International Security Assistance Force” (ISAF). <br />ISAF’s initial focus for the 5,000 strong deployment was to make the area in and around Kabul safe, broadening its presence to the rest of the country over various phases. The first Danish contribution to ISAF was primarily army sappers/engineers who would clear mines and unexploded munitions that could be found everywhere after decades of war. The Danish contribution also included liaison and logistics officers, as well as a Civilian-Military Cooperation (CIMIC) team.<br />During this time ISAF command rotated every sixth month among the participating nations who had volunteered support. The force was therefore commanded at various times by countries which included the United Kingdom, Turkey and Germany. Finding someone who was willing and able to assume command was not always an easy task, however. As most participating countries were already members of NATO, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1510 in October 2003, transferring the operation to NATO. The resolution also expanded ISAF’s mandate to cover the whole of Afghanistan. This was necessary, partly due to a reduced US involvement in the country after its invasion of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and partly because the Taliban who had been driven out in 2002 had regrouped in the border territories and had returned to Afghanistan with renewed strength.<br />The expansion took place over four phases. During the first phase, ISAF expanded to cover northern Afghanistan from December 2003. The second phase was launched in February 2005, covering the western part of the country. The third phase began in July 2006, when ISAF assumed control of the southern provinces, where the Taliban had their strongest foothold. Finally, the eastern provinces came under ISAF control in October 2006, which meant that the operation now covered the whole of Afghanistan. The greatest resistance was seen during phases three and four, when the operation moved into the Pashtun homelands where the Taliban had originated and had now reasserted control in certain regions.<br />All the various methods that were applied by ISAF can be grouped under two overriding principles: Light Footprint and Afghan Face. Common to both principles was the intention that ISAF should not be considered an occupying force similar to the one deployed by the Soviet Union during the 1980s. Light Footprint meant that only a few armed units would be stationed in the area whenever possible. Instead, Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRT) were deployed, combining and integrating military and civilian support that would help to rebuild the broken country. Afghan Face was all about making the various projects around the country Afghan projects rather than international community projects. The Afghans would thus themselves be responsible for the performance and selection of the various projects, receiving only funding and advice from the international community.<br />Denmark contributed various different types of support to ISAF at many different locations in Afghanistan. The first of these was the deployment of army engineers to Kabul. As part of the first (northern) phase, Denmark deployed 45 personnel to the German-commanded Fazabad mission. As ISAF expanded west, Denmark's contribution included a smaller contingent to a Lithuanian PRT in Chaghcharan. Denmark’s biggest contribution took place during the third phase, in the south of Afghanistan. An initial deployment of 200 personnel (that would eventually increase to 700 Danish troops at one time) was sent to the Helmand province. This was one of the most unstable regions of Afghanistan and the deployed troops would be involved on several occasions in difficult combat engagements against the Taliban, while facing a constant threat from roadside explosive devices (IEDs). In addition to these pronounced contributions, Denmark also deployed Operational Mentoring and Liaison Teams (OMLTs) on multiple occasions. These are small teams whose role was to train, advise and mentor Afghan army units, with the aim that Afghan security forces would eventually be able to gain full control of the region. <br />At its peak in 2010 the international military contribution numbered approximately 150,000 troops. This number would gradually decrease. ISAF formally withdrew from Afghanistan in 2014, as security had been transferred to Afghan army and police units throughout the country. At the request of the Afghan government, Denmark and the international community continued to maintain their commitment in Afghanistan, however. Denmark continued to provide support to Afghanistan as part of Resolute Support Mission (RSM), a mission that does not involve combat units. The priority here was to train security forces and officials so that Afghanistan will be able to assume responsibility for its own national development.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>DEVELOPMENT<br />The Taliban régime was toppled at the end of 2001. A provisional government that would be headed by Hamid Karzai was agreed at the Bonn conference. Not only was Afghanistan in ruins after decades of war, but it had never actually even had a modern infrastructure, schools and hospitals outside its cities. Its population had no real experience of democracy, beyond the traditional tribal council and corruption was rife. Rebuilding Afghanistan has been a massive task ever since, both in terms of the physical aspects and when it came to setting up robust institutions and security forces that would be able to govern the country going forward.</p>\n<p><em>From Loya Jirga to referendums.</em> <br />Hamid Karzai and the provisional government that had been appointed at the conference in Bonn sat for half a year until a Loya Jirga (a traditional tribal council) was convened to appoint a new transitional government. Over the course of one month during the summer of 2002, approximately 1,600 delegates from the various tribes, clans, communities, ethnicities and regions discussed the course of future events. At the Loya Jirga, a broad cross-section of Afghans accepted the decisions that were made at the Bonn conference, on Afghan soil. Karzai and his government were thus given a mandate to continue for up to two years, with a view to drawing up a constitution and conducting democratic elections.<br />Another Loya Jirga was convened in December 2003. This time it was attended by 500 delegates from various groups and factions, one quarter of whom were women. The purpose this time was to adopt a constitution. The biggest issue was a discussion of the degree to which power should be assigned to a president in Kabul, or whether it should be increasingly delegated to the individual regions and provinces. The final constitution was adopted, with a strong presidential powers but with provincial councils to take care of local issues. Karzai continued as president in the transitional government that had been appointed to get things ready for actual presidential elections. When these were held the following year, they proceeded relatively peacefully. Karzai was elected to the position as the first democratically elected head of state in Afghanistan’s history.<br />In the meantime, the Taliban had resurfaced. After being driven out at the beginning of 2002, they had regrouped in the uncontrollable Pashtun border territories, primarily on the Pakistani side of the Durand Line. During 2003 and 2004 they returned, particularly in the south of Afghanistan where the roots of the movement had been established. Formally, the area was under the control of the Afghan government and American troops. Because of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, many American units had been withdrawn, as many Westerners believed that the Taliban had been completely defeated rather than scattered.<br />The first parliamentary elections were held in 2005, after being postponed for a year. The Taliban and other opposition groups had sworn to prevent the elections from being held, but things proceeded relatively peacefully, regardless. Even though Karzai had been quick and willing to organise the presidential elections that would cement his own position, he was not all that keen on the idea of parliamentary elections that would establish another power within the state. Arguing that the population perceived political parties to be part of Communism, Karzai banned them for the elections and forced every candidate to stand as an independent, rather than as a block that would be able to oppose him. Parliament became a power factor anyway and was able to block some of Karzai’s decisions and to reorganise the legal system and judiciary that had been appointed by Karzai and the transitional government.<br />Karzai’s presidency was due to end in May 2009. Because of the highly unstable security situation the election was postponed by three months, during which he continued to sit as president despite serious criticism. He won the August elections a second time, but over 2,000 complaints were filed about fraud or voter intimidation. After a long investigation, a rerun was called, but his opponent and former foreign minister Abduallah Abdullah decided to step down. Hamid Karzai’s presidency came to a definitive end in 2014, as the constitution forbade him for standing for a third term. This made him not only the first democratically-elected head of the Afghan state, but also the first in over a century to step down without being assassinated or forced into exile. Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah were the main candidates for the presidential post after Karzai. The elections were characterised by a lively and pluralistic media debate. Many Afghan defied Taliban threats and cast their vote anyway. About a third of all votes cast were cast by women. The elections were close, so close in fact that one candidate won at the first count and the other after a recount. After a short period of inertia a solution was found, whereby Ghani would be president and Abdullah would serve in a newly-created “administrative director” position, which is often compared with that of prime minister.<br />There would be parliamentary elections again in 2016. Before these could take place a new voter-registration system had to be set up, which turned out to be easier said than done. The elections were therefore postponed several times, but a new system was eventually introduced and the elections were finally held in 2018.</p>\n<p>S<em>ecurity forces, stability and problem areas.</em> <br />Initially, Afghanistan’s security forces were comprised of people from the Northern Alliance and other armed factions who had foreseen the overthrow of the Taliban and who had got out while they still had the chance. There had been no real government in large areas of Afghanistan for a long time and even before the wars of the late 20th Century, police and local officials had been more interested in lining their own pockets than helping the Afghan population. This meant that the task of building a robust and credible police force, army and state institutions that would be worthy of the population’s trust would be immense.<br />Afghanistan’s security forces were officially formed by a presidential decree in 2002. Recruits began to be accepted for training that would establish a new core force. Initially, the various armed groups would at times end up on the official payroll but would be gradually integrated into an actual police force and armed forces. The Afghan National Army (ANA) and Afghan National Police (ANP) are the two de facto security forces in Afghanistan.. A number of specialised police units also exist.<br />The police and armed forces have seldom been well-paid career options in Afghanistan and, even though salaries have been raised, corruption continued to represent a serious challenge. Rising to a senior position was as likely to be based on having the right contacts as it was to actual suitability. Small decisions were often sent all the way to the top, especially if they involve supplies and fuel. <br />The security forces were making some progress, however. Not only have their wages increased. The force also increased in size from virtually nothing to approximately 350,000 personnel when the police and armed forces were combined. Professional standards were also far higher now than previously. More and more personnel received training abroad or from the international training missions in Afghanistan, or by colleagues who have been trained internationally. The police had largely transitioned away from tasks such as guard duties and fighting insurgents towards operating as a more “normal” police force. The Taliban and other militant groups remained a challenge, especially in rural areas and in the south and east, but dealing with them was largely been left to the ANA. Negotiations were also conducted in parallel with Taliban and other militant groups that oppose the state.<br />Illiteracy continues to be a serious problem in Afghanistan, as only about half of all men and a quarter of all women are able to read. Despite multiple attempts at modernisation during the 20th Century and investment in education and compulsory schooling, education never became widespread outside the larger towns. This means that finding qualified recruits was a major challenge, not just for the ANP but also for the administration and the political system. Many of Afghanistan's political leaders were therefore Afghans who spent the war years in the West, often attending prestigious universities. This weaked their legitimacy with regard to how they were viewed by the broader population.<br />Women’s rights also continued to be a problem. Men and women have equal status by law and all forms of violence against women are specifically forbidden. Yet in many places, and especially in the Pashtun areas where the Taliban originated, women’s rights continued to be face pressure from conservative forces. A woman’s virtue is a central concept of Pashtunwali and a man's honour is highly dependent on it. Arranged marriages continue to be the norm in many places. A woman often has not other choice than to abscond from the wedding, which can lead to revenge attacks by the offended clan if no compensation is paid or no other woman is found to marry the young man. Progress was being made, however. Several women's rights groups and refuges for women who have suffered violence were set up. More and more women received education, taking up political positions and, as stated previously, were more likely to vote in elections than was expected by many. <br />The Afghan state has always been strongest in the towns, growing weaker the further you go into rural areas. This continues to be the case. The international contribution also reflected this in its “Inkdrop” strategy, in which there was focus on a single market town (as was the case with the Danish mission in Gereshk), creating a safe environment and development that locals were able to really feel and notice, allowing it to gradually spread to larger and larger areas.</p>\n<p>Afg<em>hanistan - now and in the future</em> <br />Afghanistan was undoubtedly a far better place than it was in 2001. About a third or more of Afghanistan’s population still lives below the poverty line and certain regions are still unsafe, but Afghanistan saw stable economic growth over recent years. About 70% of the population is less than 25 years old and the labour force is growing by about 400,000 a year. If no jobs are available and the young population is unable to see that it has a future, it will be far more likely to join groups like the Taliban or get involved with the illegal but lucrative opium trade, in which Afghanistan continues to be the biggest manufacturer.<br />The vast majority of the budget (almost 90%) was in 2020 financed by foreign aid. State institutions remained weak and were having difficulty collecting taxes, as the country is generally poor and parts of the economy are lost to corruption. Aid from the international community continues to be important, both in terms of financing the Afghan state until it can achieve full autonomy and in terms of combating corruption and developing its national institutions. The Taliban have been battling the state for years and, continue to have a serious impact on peace and stability. There was plenty to suggest that the best way to bring the war and unrest to a close would be through a negotiated solution in which the Taliban and other factions were able to occupy a legitimate role within society.<br />If Afghanistan is to achieve real stability and a well-functioning state system there is still a lot of work that remains to be done. It still needs aid and support from a world that has a past record of forgetting about it when it is no longer essential to the strategic interests of the world’s superpowers.</p>"

The West attempted to establish peace in Afghanistan by entering into agreements with the Taliban in the hope of ending the war. In February 2020, the USA successfully negotiated a peace treaty with the Taliban that would ensure a peaceful transfer of power when international forces moved out of the country during 2021. The president of the USA, Joe Biden, announced in the Spring of 2021 that American armed forces would be out of Afghanistan before 11 September of the same year.

At the same time, almost all nations began to evacuate their personnel, journalists and other foreigners, as well as select Afghanis who had recently worked for the international forces and embassies.

They are the borderlands between the Ottoman and Habsburg empires, with a fluid population and ambitions of power and domination. The seeds of nationalism were sown and would grow into new problems and new opportunities. More recently this would result in the formation of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, united by a strong centralised power figureheaded by Tito.<br />It became a popular tourist destination and hosted the 1984 Winter Olympic games in Sarajevo, but beneath the surface the ever-present tensions continued to simmer. How could it be possible to hold a federation together that was comprised of six republics and two autonomous provinces whose names we know today because of the events of the late 20th Century? Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kosovo, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia.<br />Yugoslavia and the Balkans broke apart in and around 1990. After 1992 we begin to learn new names and concepts: ethnic cleansing, siege, massacre, Srebrenica, war crimes, UNPROFOR, white-painted Danish Leopard tanks, IFOR and SFOR and the Dayton Agreement. Thousands of Danes from Danish Defence, the Danish Police and the Danish Emergency Management Agency would serve in this corner of Europe between 1992 and 2005 as part of UN forces, UN police deployments, OSCE, UN emergency aid services etc. or as part of the post-1995 UN presence, continuing to assist in the EU commitment that followed it. <br />This is a complex period of European history.

                        "text": "<p>UP TO THE 1980s<br />The Balkans have long been an area where many different cultures have been able to come together as friends or face each other as competitors and warring factions. A number of tribes migrated to the region from the North and East during the early Middle Ages. The common denominator of these tribes was that they all spoke dialects of the Slavic language that was also widespread in what is now Russia, the Czech Republic and Poland. As the southernmost Slavic people, they would over time become known as the Southern Slavs, or Yugo Slavija in Slavic. Although they were able to communicate with each other, there were regional differences between the Yugoslavian dialects, varying from Slovenian in the North to Macedonian in the South. The various regions would shift between warring, making alliances and trading among themselves and with their neighbours. As time went on, they would unite as various principalities and kingdoms and missionaries would arrive from neighbouring countries to convert the pagan Slavs to Christianity.<br />The orthodox patriarch in Constantinople and the Catholic Pope in Rome both tried to convert the people of the region to their own differing interpretations of Christianity. Eventually a vague boundary line would be drawn through what is now present-day Bosnia-Herzegovina. North and West of this line, Croats and Slovenians were baptised as Roman Catholics and learned the Roman alphabet. Groups in the South and East like the Serbs and Montenegrins were, conversely, baptised by missionaries who had been sent from Byzantium. These regions therefore use the same Cyrillic alphabet as is used in Russian and they are part of the Orthodox Church. Despite the differences in religious observance and alphabet there were no major problems. Even today, a Serb and a Croat can understand each other’s conversation, even though they may find it difficult to understand each other’s writing. <br />As the Middle Ages drew to a close the independent South Slavic principalities came to an end too. The Ottoman empire had grown powerful in the East and the Serbs found themselves besieged by the Ottomans in 1389 at Kosovo Polje. After this battle large areas of the Balkans would be absorbed into the Ottoman Empire. During this period the Croats and Slovenians would also gradually submit to Hungarian rule.</p>\n<p><em>Between Istanbul and Vienna</em>. <br />The population was not only divided between two different interpretations of the Christian faith, but they were now being ruled by two of the greatest superpowers in Europe, who also happened to be one another’s greatest rivals. Countless wars and smaller conflicts raged in the Balkans for centuries between the Habsburg Monarchy (or Empire) that was ruled by its monarch in Vienna and the Ottoman Empire that was ruled by the Sultan in Istanbul. This meant that the southern Slavic peoples often found themselves on different sides during warfare and were influenced by two different cultures. The Ottoman Empire was multi-ethnic and multi-faith. Because it was a mainly Muslim empire, however, there were a number of social and economic benefits available for those who belonged to the Muslim faith. Many of the Sultan’s subjects therefore decided to convert to Islam, even though most European provinces in the Ottoman Empire remained Christian. Well-functioning multi-faith societies arose, especially in the vicinity of large towns that also functioned as administrative centres, like Sarajevo and Mostar. Many people did, however, decide to leave their homes or had to flee as a result of war and oppression. Thousands of Serbs therefore migrated north during the 17th and 18th Centuries, where they were given land as settlers in otherwise Croat, Slovenian and Hungarian regions that were ruled from Vienna. There was one requirement, however. They would have to continue living in the militarised borderland regions and assist in their defence. In Croatia they therefore became known as Krajina Serbs. “Krajina” means “border” in Serbo-Croat. In areas like Vojvodina that were otherwise Hungarian and near the Croatian town of Knin, Krajina Serbs would become a majority population.<br />What would eventually evolve into Yugoslavia was therefore an area of highly diverse ethnicity and faith. Protestants, Catholics, Orthodox and Muslims; Romanians, Hungarians, Turks, Italians, Albanians, Greeks and Bulgarians, in addition to Serbs, Croats, Bosnians, Slovenians, Macedonians and Montenegrins. Although rebellion against Istanbul or Vienna was planned on various occasions on the basis of arguments like ethnic or national oppression, it is worth remembering that the various religious and ethnic communities were able to co-exist on an everyday basis without serious friction. The various groups co-existed in perfect harmony until the 19th Century. Conflicts were seldom due to ethnicity and were instead wars of “big politics” between and Emperor and a Sultan or between local princes and the central authority.</p>\n<p><em>World War and Revolution.</em> <br />During the 19th Century the region was therefore divided into various important cultures that were each headed in their own direction. Some looked to Istanbul for leadership, while others looked to Vienna. The region has harsh mountainous terrain and with war and flight a constant reality, its people had become tough and independent.<br />Nationalism finally arrived in the region and people began to view themselves as part of communities that were based on language, ethnicity, faith or some other factor. The Serbs eventually won self-rule from the Ottoman Empire at the beginning of the 19th Century and would later achieve full independence. The Croats and Slovenians had meanwhile also been able to attain a greater degree of autonomy within the Austro-Hungarian Empire.<br />Bosnia, which had been an Ottoman province, was occupied by Austro-Hungarian forces in 1878 during the same period as its neighbouring country had begun to envisage a Kingdom of Greater Serbia and others had begun talking about a Yugoslavian Union. At the end of the 19th Century the Balkans were therefore considered to be the powder keg of Europe, where there was potential for armed conflict as the Ottoman Empire collapsed. As the Balkan Wars were underway in the early 20th Century, the participating nations: Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece and Montenegro hurried to occupy Ottoman regions to ensure a stronger competitive basis against each other. During the summer of 1914 a group of young Bosnian Serbs with nationalist ambitions for a united Greater Serbia was successful in its attempt to assassinate Duke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, during his visit to Sarajevo. The diplomatic crisis that followed initially escalated into a war between Austro-Hungary and Serbia but would soon, after interference by European superpowers (for a variety of motives) evolve into the First World War.<br />Both the Emperor of Austro-Hungary and the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire would see their empires collapse. States took their own chunks from what was left, while the nationalist movements in each empire fought to secede as independent states in the new world order that would rise from the ashes of world war. Even though Serbia had been under Austro-Hungarian occupation for most of the war, it found itself on the winning side and the king of Serbia was declared King of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenians, which would later be renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. This first united version of Yugoslavia was, however, characterised by the fact that it had been founded by and was governed from Serbia. The populations of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Montenegro, Kosovo and Macedonia were considered to be Serbian, whether they liked it or not. The Croats and Slovenians wanted a more federal state. This first Kingdom of Yugoslavia was therefore unstable and saw military coups, political assassinations and various attempts to reform its internal political system. When a government under pressure came out on the side of Germany in 1941 during the Second World War, the people responded by demonstrating and a coup d’état was executed. Yugoslavia was invaded by Germany and Italy soon afterwards.<br />The Croatian Ustashe fascist party now occupied power in the puppet Independent State of Croatia and was responsible for attacks on Serbian minorities and the establishment of concentration camps. During the war various resistance organisations fought against the Croatian Ustashe state and the military occupation. There were so-called Chetniks, who were primarily Serbian and nationalist elements from the Yugoslavian army who continued to see themselves as loyal to the royal family and the former state. The largest resistance movement was the partisans, however. These were led by Josip Broz Tito and the Communist Party. The partisans tried to break down ethnic barriers and fought for a united socialist Yugoslavia after the war. The two groups had mutual issues and engagements between Chetniks and partisans were almost as common as engagements against occupying forces. As the war drew to an end, the partisans were clearly in the strongest position. They were able to liberate large areas of the country from its occupier before the end of the war. After the war Yugoslavia was established as a federal socialist republic under Tito’s leadership.</p>\n<p><em>Tension in Yugoslavia</em> <br />The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was divided into six republics, each of equal official status. From North to South these were: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia. Kosovo and Vojvodina were also part of the Federal Republic. There were two self-governing provinces with large ethnic minority populations, both of which were part of Serbia. Yugoslavia was governed for many years by Josip Broz Tito, who was the country’s founder and president and the leader of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The party itself was also divided into the League of Communists of Slovenia, the League of Communists of Serbia and so on. Although both state and party were divided federally by ethnic group, it was a taboo subject to talk about ethnic and religious boundaries and the mobilisation of nationalist movements was in breach of the constitution. All languages also had equal official status. Under the Yugoslavian state’s official “Brotherhood and Unity” motto, its people were expected to work together to modernise their country and represent a positive role model for others, including Communist dictatorships further East. Although nationalist tendencies were officially dead and buried, a number of issues remained that, after Tito’s death in 1980, would lead to increased nationalism and the collapse of the federation a decade later.</p>\n<p><em>After Tito? Tito!</em> <br />With Tito and the former wartime partisans at the forefront, nationalist leaders were either executed or forced into exile at the end of the Second World War. Once the Chetniks and Ustashe were dead or exiled Yugoslavia tried to unite the various factions, hoping that the various peoples of Yugoslavia would, over time, be able to see themselves as one united Yugoslavian people.<br />Nobody lives for ever. And neither did Tito. The party met in 1974 and wrote a new constitution in preparation for the country’s governance after his death, The “After Tito? Tito!” slogan made Tito president for life. A joint presidential office was set up to succeed him, which would appoint eight members, one from each region of the country. Each of the members would alternate as president. Major decisions would require agreement within the council of presidents and, because agreement was not always achievable, this led to instability in government. Each of the republics was also given greater autonomy. Many Serbs were unhappy about this development. As the largest republic, and being the ethnic grouping of which the largest numbers resided in other parts of the country, Serbs would have preferred to see a powerful, centrally-governed Yugoslavia under Serb leadership.</p>\n<p><em>Financial crisis</em> <br />There had been large differences in the state of the economy in Yugoslavia’s various regions. Slovenia and Croatia had already industrialised during the 19th Century and had better-developed economies than the autonomous or Ottoman regions of Yugoslavia in the South and East. After the Second World War, these were largely agricultural societies in which a large proportion of the population had received no education. The northern and western states had also benefited from European tourism, which had boomed during post-war years.<br />A financial crisis during the 1980s became heightened when international economic organisations like the IMF and the World Bank were no longer willing to lend unless Yugoslavia was willing to implement structural economic reforms. Macedonia, Montenegro and, to some extent, Serbia were worst affected and the reallocation of funding from the wealthier North to the more impoverished South turned into a political conflict between the republics.</p>\n<p><em>Ethnic Problems</em> <br />Ethnic problems continued to exist, despite the official stance of burying nationalism and creating a common Yugoslavian identity. As nationalism increased during the late 1980s and Slovenia and Croatia declared independence, the notion of ethnic cleansing began to rear its ugly head once again. During the Second World War the Croat Ustashe régime had been responsible for some of the worst acts of “cleansing” in the region, with an official policy that one third of Croat Serbs should be liquidated, a third deported and a third converted to Catholicism and “turned into” Croats. The term “ethnic cleansing” is a direct translation from the Serbo-Croat term \"etnicko ciscenje\" and entails an attempt to create an ethnically “pure” region. This can be achieved by genocide, as was seen during the Holocaust in Nazi Germany, and by forcibly converting and/or deporting a population or by using violent means and threats to force a population to leave. The destruction of cultural and historic monuments like churches and mosques can also be used when trying to erase the history of an ethnic group within the population. Genocide and ethnic cleansing are not entirely synonymous, as the intent that underlies the actions are different. Both are, however, considered by the UN and international conventions as war crimes and crimes against humanity.<br />Croatia was still home to a large Serb minority, the so-called Krajina-Serbs, who had settled in the area when it was part of the militarised borderlands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the capital city being Knin in southern Croatia. This was also true in Slovenia. As nationalism was on the rise at the end of the 1980s, Serbs in both regions feared for their future and attempted to declare independence.<br />Bosnia-Herzegovina was the most ethnically-diverse region of Yugoslavia. This was home to the majority of Yugoslavia’s Muslims, who were considered an ethnicity. Bosnian Muslims were often the most active supporters of a common Yugoslavian state and identity. Many Serbs and Croats also lived in the state, however. These factions wanted to belong to a Serb or Croat state if Yugoslavia was to be dissolved. Some villages in Bosnia-Herzegovina were populated by a single ethnicity, whereas others were mixed, sometimes with districts that were divided by ethnicity. Especially in the larger towns, people would live and intermarry, making no distinction about ethnic affiliations.<br />Serbia was one of the most ethnically distinct regions, being home to a majority population that was undeniably Serb. The two autonomous provinces of Kosovo and Vojvodina were part of Serbia, however. Over half of the population of Vojvodina was Serb, but during the 1980s somewhere between 10 and 20% of the population was ethnically Hungarian. Romanians and Roma also lived in Vojvodina, which was autonomous and had a seat in the council of presidents. Kosovo was home to a large Serb minority population and, as the heartland of medieval Serbia, Kosovo has played a major role in Serbian identity politics. During the 1980s, however, about 80% of Kosovo’s population spoke Albanian and the vast majority were Muslims, which was why Kosovo had been allowed to self-govern and had a representative in the council of presidents. Many Kosovo-Albanians wanted Kosovo to be a republic with equal status within the Yugoslavian Federation, but complaints about discrimination and harassment by Albanians contributed to starting the conflict that would eventually spread throughout Yugoslavia.</p>\n<p><em>Propaganda and the quest for power.</em> <br />Alongside the many ethnic, economic and political problems, nationalism began to become an increasingly important factor during the 1980s. Certain factions and politicians continued to stoke the flames by mobilising the population’s sense of national identity, as they attempted to gain power or get their own way. The cracks had already begun to show as early as 1969-1971, during the so-called \"Croatian Spring”. Encouraged by its leaders, Croatia had blossomed both culturally and nationally, which before long led to demands for increased self-rule for the republic. Tito and the Yugoslavian régime considered this to be a nationalist move, which led to increased controls and several Croatian politicians found themselves in court.<br />It was, however, in Serbia that the problems would really come to the surface, with regard to its relationship with Kosovo, where there were demonstrations in 1981. The Albanians who lived in Kosovo wanted to see Kosovo as a republic with equal status, rather than a self-governing province of Serbia. The Serb-dominated Yugoslavian police and military cracked down hard on the demonstrations and order was restored with no change to Kosovo’s status. Just a few years later, in 1986, a memorandum was published that would be of major importance to the years that followed. This text concerned the crisis in Yugoslavia, viewed from a Serbian perspective. Instead of presenting proposed solutions, it criticised the 1974 constitution’s decentralisation and blamed Croatia and Slovenia for the poor state of the economy. It also claimed that Serbs in Kosovo, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina were victims of oppression and of political and cultural attacks that the memorandum went so far as to characterise as genocide.<br />Because of the massive tension in Yugoslavia, Serb politician Slobodan Milosevic was sent to Kosovo during the spring of 1987 to listen to the population’s grievances and calm the situation. During this visit, he made his famous announcement to Serb demonstrators who had gathered in protest at Kosovo Polje “Nobody will beat you ever again.” Later the same year he would depose the Serbian president and take the position himself. In the time that followed Milosevic would place supporters in charge of Vojvodina and Montenegro, and removed Kosovo’s right to self-govern. As it now controlled four of the Communist Party’s eight divisions, the other republics feared increased centralisation of power around Serbia and Milosevic. An attempt was made to resolve this conflict at a major party congress in 1990. Milosevic, however, brought the votes from Serbia, Kosovo, Vojvodina and Montenegro to bear to vote down all proposals towards a federal state or for the various republics to self-govern. Eventually, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia walked out of the congress. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia was thus dissolved and democratic multi-party elections were held over the course of 1990 in the various republics, nationalist parties winning the elections in most areas.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>A PATCHWORK<br />The Balkan peninsula has historically been a meeting place for many great cultures. Its population has been divided by various factors over the ages into numerous groupings since the days of the original inhabitants of the region known as Illyria by the Roman: the migration of Slavic peoples to the region, conversions to Greek Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, influences from Venetian merchants and the rule of Austro-Hungarian and Turkish Ottoman overlords. Each factor has had an impact that has pulled one way or another. Migrations, deportations, refugees, religious converts and attempts to create a common supranational identity made the former Yugoslavia an area that was home to many different ethnic and religious groups, but an area where it was difficult to map out the borders. People from the various groups lived scattered in mixed areas. The six republics and two self-governing provinces that comprised Yugoslavia were therefore ethnically mixed, composed not only of people from the various Yugoslavian population groups but also people of other nationalities, primarily from neighbouring Balkan countries and the countries that had controlled the region during earlier periods of history.<br />The financial situation of each of the geographic areas meant that economic development in the various regions progressed at different rates. This, combined with the varying levels of friendship and hostility between the different regions and populations, combined with affiliations to ethnic groups in neighbouring countries outside Yugoslavia, would result in serious tensions within the federation.</p>\n<p><em>Slovenia</em> <br />Slovenia was the northernmost region of the former Yugoslavia, which meant that it was historically a little isolated from the rest of the country. As a language, Slovenian is different to Serbo-Croat, partly because of its origins and partly because it adopted many words from neighbouring Austria and Italy. Historically, the Slovenians are Catholic and use the Latin alphabet. Slovenia was one of the most economically developed regions. As part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Slovenia was industrialised during the 19th Century and had railway links to both Budapest and Vienna. As part of Yugoslavia, Slovenia’s tourist industry would boom because of the natural beauty of its mountains and its short distance and historical relationships with Italy and Austria.<br />Unlike the rest of Yugoslavia, Slovenia had no large minority populations. The biggest ethnic groups apart from the Slovenians themselves live in the border regions where Slovenia meets Italy, Austria and Hungary. Because of an influx of refugees from the bloody conflict that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia, Slovenia now has bigger Serb and Bosnian minority populations that it had when Yugoslavia was still a federation.<br />Because the Slovenians were major contributors to Yugoslavia’s federal economy, they would eventually tire of the redistribution of wealth from North to South, especially when they too were affected by a financial crisis during the 1980s. The desire for increased self-rule led to a confrontation with Milosevic and his attempt to centralise Yugoslavia at the 1990 party congress. Their representatives walked out and Slovenia would be the first region to declare independence. The conflict and fighting with the Yugoslavian army that followed would only last for ten days, after which Slovenia became independent.</p>\n<p><em>Croatia</em> <br />In terms of economy, history and religion, Croatia is very similar to its Slovenian neighbour to the North. The Croats are also predominantly Cathollic, were ruled by Austro-Hungary and have a relatively well-developed economy, with industry and tourism. The Croat language also uses Latin letters, but this is also the greatest difference between Croat and Serbian, as both are otherwise dialects of the same language. As the next-largest group after the Serbs, there has often been rivalry between Serbs and Croats in Yugoslavia.<br />Croatia was also home to large minority populations, including in particular the Krajina Serbs, who had arrived as refugees from the Ottoman Empire and were settled and armed by the Austrian administration to protect the region against Ottoman pillaging raids. Croats in the pre-Second World War Kingdom of Yugoslavia considered themselves to be the victims of oppression by the kingdom’s Serb élite. Between the two World Wars Croat self-government was long a topic of disagreement and would culminate during the Second World War, when the Independent State of Croatia, led by the fascist Ushtashe party, was responsible for concentration camps and attempts to ethnically cleanse the region of its Serb minority. The Ushtashe régime was defeated by Tito (who was actually a Croat) and his Communist partisans. During the Communist era in Yugoslavia the Croats often stood alongside the Slovenians in the fight for a more federal system. When the Slovenians walked out of the 1990 party congress, they were immediately followed by the Croats. Croatia declared independence soon afterwards, headed by the nationalist Franjo Tudjman as president and the Serb minority feared that there would be a regression to the horrors of the Ustashe régime. Yugoslavia’s Serb-dominated army initially attempted to occupy Croatia in its entirety, but was unsuccessful. This resulted in a declaration of independence by Serb-populated areas with support from Yugoslavia, which became known as the Republic of Serbian Krajina. This led to a long war, during which the first UN troops (UNPROFOR) were deployed to Yugoslavia.<br />Many Croats also lived as minorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. When Croatia declared independence, Bosnian Croats were divided between those who supported an independent Bosnia-Herzegovina and those who wanted to secede from the multi-ethnic country in the hope of unification with Croatia. This meant that Bosnian Croats would sometimes work alongside Bosnian Muslims in opposition to the Serbs. This was not all that happened, however. There was also fighting and ethnic cleansing among Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Since their independence, Croatia and Montenegro have disagreed about the Prevlaka peninsula, which was occupied during the Croatian War of Independence by Yugoslavian troops operating on behalf of Montenegro.</p>\n<p><em>Bosnia-Herzegovina</em> <br />Bosnia-Herzegovina was the most divided of the republics that jointly comprised Yugoslavia and is located in the middle of the former federation. Bosnia-Herzegovina was often trapped between two powerful Yugoslavian rivals; Serbia and Croatia. Its population all spoke Serbo-Croat, but was largely split into communities along religious lines. The Catholics saw themselves as Croats, whereas the Orthodox population identified as Serb. The largest groups in the country were its Muslims, however, and had been considered an ethnicity since 1960s. During the conflict of the 1990s these Muslims began to be called \"Bosniaks” instead of simply “Muslims” or “Bosnian Muslims”. Bosnia-Herzegovina has historically also been at the heart of events. The area was occupied by both the Ottomans and the Austro-Hungarians. Between the World Wars it was dominated by its Serbs and during the Second World War it became part of the fascist Independent State of Croatia. When it was part of Tito’s Yugoslavia, it was in the multi-ethnic towns that most people identified as Yugoslavian. When the federation broke apart its Muslim leadership tried stubbornly to maintain Bosnia’s status as a mixed state, while both Serbs and Croats worked to split the country between Serbia and Croatia or into independent ethnic states.<br />Bosnia-Herzegovina was one of the least economically-developed regions when Yugoslavia was founded, as it had only been a province on the periphery of the Ottoman Empire. The area was characterised by constantly having to adapt, one example being an extended occupation by Austro-Hungary before it was integrated into the empire as an actual province. During the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, much of the country was overlooked by the Serb-dominated government, which would also be the case during the beginnings of Communist Yugoslavia. When Tito broke with the Soviet Union, the Bosnian economy was developed thanks to large investments that were made in the state.<br />When Croatia and Slovenia left the Yugoslavian Federation, Bosnian leaders feared that Bosnia-Herzegovina would be marginalised as part of a Serb-dominated state. Despite valiant attempts by its multinational leadership, the country’s new parties would be on the basis of ethnic affiliations. The referendum on independence was boycotted by the Serb population. Before long the Serb areas declared their own independence as Republika Srpska (loosely translated, the Serb Republic) and established paramilitary forces that were armed and supported by the Yugoslavian army. A similar movement was in motion in Croat areas, supported by the newly-independent Croatia. When fighting began in the form of a major Serb offensive, Bosnian Croats fought alongside the Bosnian Muslim army. Bosnia-Herzegovina would be the area of the former Yugoslavia that was longest and most badly impacted by the breakup, suffering countless cases of ethnic cleansing and massacres and the besieging of its capital, Sarajevo, which lasted almost four years. Various UN initiatives were attempted to stop the war, which would not be brought to an end until NATO carried out an extensive air campaign.</p>\n<p><em>Serbia</em> <br />Not only was Serbia the largest of the republics that comprised the former Yugoslavia, it was also the one in which the population was most broadly distributed. Large numbers of Serbs lived, in particular, in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and these Serbs wanted to be part of a state of Yugoslavia or a greater Serbian state rather than live as a minority in another nation state. The Serbs have been the dominant group in Yugoslavia historically, not only because they were the largest group but also partly because it led the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as an independent state after the First World War. Even though Serbia was not as prosperous as Croatia and Slovenia during the 1980s, the republic did have one of Yugoslavia’s stronger economies, based on agriculture and industry. Not only was Belgrade the capital of Serbia, but of the entire Federation of Yugoslavia, which attracted many politicians and officials to the city, who brought jobs and investments with them.<br />Like their neighbours in Macedonia and Montenegro, the Serbs had converted to Orthodox Christianity during the Middle Ages. Because of their shared history, these three states would often stand together within the Federation of Yugoslavia. This would not always be problem-free, however. In the Serb national discourse during the days of the Kingdom of Serbia and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia between the two World Wars, Montenegrins and Macedonians were viewed as Serbs who spoke with a bit of a dialect. Many Montenegrins and Macedonians took issue with this.<br />Serbia itself was largely populated by Serbs, but both of the autonomous provinces of the former Yugoslavia were inside Serbia and each had their own ethnic characteristics. In Vojvodina there was a Serb majority population, but the largest minority population spoke Hungarian. When Slobodan Milosevic came to power in Serbia, he used his support among Serb minority populations to put his own man in charge of Vojvodina. Despite, or perhaps because of, its multi-ethnic nature, Vojvodina continued to be part of the former Yugoslavia and is now a self-governing region of Serbia. Because of the strong levels of Serbian nationalism, many people from the minority populations left the region, which was instead populated by Serb refugees from Croatia and Bosnia. The region continues to be ethnically diverse at the time of writing. Kosovo, however, has an Albanian majority population but has a large role in Serbian identity as the capital of medieval Serbian kingdoms and the site of their defeat by the Ottomans. It was here that Slobodan Milosevic’s journey to the presidency gained tempo when he made himself the spokesman of Kosovo’s Serbs and promoted the agenda that they were oppressed and subject to violations by the Albanian majority. Milosevic and the Serbs were able to maintain a relative state of peace in Kosovo during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia. After conflict and a NATO air campaign at the end of the 1990s Kosovo’s self-governing status was returned. A UN peacekeeping force was deployed and Kosovo later declared independence.<br />Although Serbian nationalism was robust and was one of the reasons for many of the conflicts, Serbia did not officially leave the Federation of Yugoslavia until it was formally dissolved and replaced by a federation that was comprised only of Serbia and Montenegro. Serbia instead continued to follow the long narrative of a united Yugoslavia when the other states began to leave the union and deployed the Yugoslavian army in attempts to prevent the secessions.</p>\n<p><em>Macedonia</em> <br />Macedonia was in the south-east corner of the former Yugoslavia. It was the poorest of the republics and, from the beginning to the end of the Federation of Yugoslavia, it received funding that came from the wealthier republics in the North. The language of Macedonia is also a dialect of Serbo-Croat, even though it is linguistically more closely-related to Bulgarian. Serbs and Bulgarians both consider Macedonians to be part of their own people. An actual Macedonian national identity did not appear until the beginning of the 20th Century, as a contrast to Greek, Serbian and Bulgarian demands. Macedonia was thus the last part of the former Ottoman Empire to become part of Yugoslavia and it was not until Tito’s Yugoslavia that the Macedonians were regarded as an independent people. Many Macedonians therefore supported the notion of a united Yugoslavia, as this was economically advantageous to them and prevented neighbouring countries with former stakes in the country from piecing out Macedonia among themselves.<br />Macedonia’s largest minority had no affiliation to any of the other republics. Macedonia’s large Albanian population wanted at various times to leave the union and join the independent Albanian state or gain independence on its own behalf. These desires led to serious conflicts in Kosovo. It was not until the new millennium that these would turn into combat engagements in Macedonia, after which it was generally possible to find compromise solutions that gave equal status to the Orthodox Macedonian majority and the Albanian-speaking Muslim minority.<br />Despite the fact that Macedonia had tried very hard to maintain the federation, it would eventually secede from the union. A referendum was held when it became clear that Slovenia and Croatia would declare independence. The result also produced a majority for independence. As a contrast with the events that transpired in the other states, where there were civil wars and ethnic cleansing, Macedonia’s declaration of independence as a sovereign state in September 1991 was relatively peaceful.</p>\n<p><em>Montenegro</em> <br />Montenegro was the smallest of the republics. Like the Serbs and Macedonians its people were orthodox Christians who wrote using the Cyrillic alphabet. When spoken, the Montenegrin dialect has more in common with Croatian than Serbian. Like the population of Macedonia, Montenegrins were considered to be part of the Serbian people by many Serbs. And, like Kosovo, Montenegro was part of the cradle of Serbian culture. Montenegro had, however, seen the rise of a sense of independent national identity because, unlike its neighbours, Montenegro had never been part of the Ottoman Empire and had been able to continue as a more or less self-governing state. Local conditions were the reason why a small country like Montenegro had been able to survive, despite being surrounded by the vast Turkish empire. A large army would starve in the small impoverished mountainous terrain and a smaller one would have been defeated by the country’s rugged mountain folk. There was, however, a fluid border of sorts which determined whether somebody was Serb or Montenegrin. Both republics also viewed themselves as the heirs to the medieval Serbian kingdoms and would therefore often work together closely within the confines of Yugoslavian politics.<br />Montenegro’s small and mountainous terrain on the outer limits of Yugoslavia made it a poor region. It had an underdeveloped economy and the bulk of its population were peasant farmers and herders. As with Macedonia, large amounts of funding were therefore diverted to Macedonia from other parts of Yugoslavia. The region continued to be extremely inaccessible and at the borderlands of Yugoslavia, which meant that development continued to progress very slowly. It was not until the country was discovered by foreign tourists during the 1980s that economic developments began to accelerate.<br />At the end of the 1980s Milosevic and the Serb nationalists successfully positioned their supporters in leading positions in Montenegro, which lead to Montenegro voting in support of Serbia and against Slovenia at the party congress in 1990. As other states seceded from Yugoslavia, Montenegro remained in the federation like Serbia. Montenegrin soldiers also fought in the Yugoslavian army against the secession of Croatia and Slovenia. Many Montenegrins also initially took part in the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Montenegrin identity continued to dominate, however, so Montenegro withdrew its units from the Yugoslavian army in protest against the conduct of the Serbs in Bosnia-Herzegovina. When the Federation of Yugoslavia was finally broken up, Montenegro joined a federation that was comprised solely of Serbia and Montenegro, until it declared independence after a democratic vote in 2006.</p>\n<p><em>Kosovo</em> <br />Kosovo is a small, mountainous region in the south-west of the Balkan peninsula. Its population is divided into two main groups: Serbs and Albanians. The current population of Kosovo is 90% Albanian and 8% Serb. This has not always been the case, however. Kosovo's history is full of stories about migrations, the meeting of religions and dramatic events that have given the region a changing population and a close relationship with its neighbours.<br />There was no Albanian state during the Middle Ages. On the contrary, the Albanian people lived in various tribes in clans spread over an area that encompassed not only present-day Albania, but also Kosovo and parts of other neighbouring countries. The Serb population was also well-distributed but came together during the Middle Ages to create a kingdom that was the strongest power in the Balkans during various periods. The mountain valleys of Montenegro and Kosovo were the heartlands of the first Serbian kingdoms and are the sites of numerous old churches, monasteries and ruins from the greatest period of Serbian history. Western Kosovo is therefore called Metohija by the Serbs, which translates to “the land of monasteries” as it was owned by the Serbian church. As the cradle of Serbian culture, many Serbs therefore consider Kosovo to be the very heart of Serbia. A pivotal battle in Kosovo also contributed towards making the area part of the Serbian national identity. A battle was fought between the Serbs and the Ottomans at Kosovo Polje in central Kosovo in 1389. It ended with Serbian defeat which, in the Serbian national consciousness, has stood as a symbol of the end of Serbia’s greatest era and the beginning of what they consider to be centuries of oppression. <br />Serbia won back its independence during the 19th Century and Kosovo was once again absorbed into Serbia when the Ottoman Empire was divided. After the First World War, Kosovo would therefore become part of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During the Second World War Albania was occupied by fascist Italy, who annexed Kosovo into their Albanian province. When the war ended and a new Communist Yugoslavia was founded under Tito’s leadership most Kosovo Albanians wanted to continue being a part of Albania. This idea was quickly dismissed and Kosovo became a self-governing province in Serbia, the largest state in the Federation of Yugoslavia. Albanian was once again a permitted language and Kosovo’s institutions and political leadership became gradually more dominated by Kosovo Albanians, especially after the 1968 student uprising. Conversely, the Serb proportion of the population also continued to decrease over the years.<br />When a new Yugoslavian constitution was introduced in 1974 Kosovo’s rights to self-govern were greatly augmented. Although Kosovo was formally still a province of Serbia, to all practical intents and purposes it had equal status with the republics that also comprised the Federation of Yugoslavia. Kosovo therefore had a member of the presidential council and was represented in federal institutions with full right of veto on an equal footing with the actual republics. <br />Milosevic took power in Serbia as the spokesman of Kosovo’s Serbs and in spring 1989 he and the Serb parliament took away Kosovo’s right to self-govern. During the summer, on 28 June that year, he brought together thousands of Serbs at Kosovo Polje. Here, Milosevic spoke of how the Serb people once again faced a pivotal battle, even though no weapons had been used at this point. Before long Kosovo’s public sector employees would be required to pledge allegiance to Serbia and Serbian curricula were introduced in schools. The political and institutional world was also dominated by Serbs. <br />This did not stop the Kosovo Albanians in their tracks. 4In 1991 they declared independence and set up a “shadow state” with an elected parliament in Kosovo. The conflict escalated in 1998, with combat engagements between Serb forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army. Thousands of people became refugees and the UN tried in vain to come up with a solution, as the UN Security Council was unable to reach agreement. NATO, however, was not willing to simply stand by and watch. An international air combat group was put together from October 1998 and Milosevic was given the choice of a ceasefire that would be monitored by international observers or aerial bombardment. Negotiations broke down on 18 March 1999 and NATO activated the air task force on 24 March. The air campaign produced an agreement with Milosevic, which included provisions for the deployment of a large task force that would be called KFOR. Tensions continued in Kosovo, but as time passed and with the support of the UN, NATO and EU, the situation improved. The parliament in Kosovo was able declare independence in 2008, which was recognised by a large number of UN, EU and NATO member states.<br />After long negotiations between Kosovo, Serbia and the EU, Kosovo and Serbia were finally able to reach their first agreement in 2013. The “Brussels Agreement” contains a number of items relating to conditions for the Serb minority in Kosovo and its ability to collaborate with Serbian institutions in northern Kosovo, including with regard to the law.</p>"

Slovenia and Croatia tried to transform the state into a voluntary federation, but Milosevic and his allies in Kosovo, Vojvodina and Montenegro voted down all proposals. Finally, the Slovenian, Croatian, Macedonian and Bosnian delegations walked out. This would mean the end of the combined party that had ruled Yugoslavia since the Second World War. <br />The following year would see the very first multiple party elections in the various Yugoslavian republics. The nationalists won power in Croatia and Slovenia during the spring and began to work towards secession as states with their own constitutions. The Croatian flag with its red and white chequerboard emblem instead of the Yugoslavian star appeared at the end of July 1990. The chequerboard emblem had been a Croat national symbol since the Middle Ages, but for the Serb minority it was reminiscent of the last régime to use it, the fascist Ushtashe (who had made war on the Serbs during the Second World War). Soon afterwards the Serb majority in the area surrounding the town of Knin declared their own autonomy, formed militias and blocked roads into the area. Serbs in other parts of Croatia followed suit later, jointly setting up the Serb autonomous region of Krajina, which generally covered the same area as the former Austrian military border, which had been populated by Serb refugees. The Krajina Serbs were determined that if Croatia left the Federation of Yugoslavia they would leave Croatia.<br />When elections were held in Bosnia-Herzegovina during November, national parties also won a majority. Unlike Croatia and Slovenia, there were three national parties in Bosnia-Herzegovina: a Serb, a Croat and a Bosnian Muslim, each of whom received a vote that roughly corresponded to their share of the multi-ethnic population. An attempt was made to form a coalition government headed by Alija Izetbegovic, a Muslim, but in the months that followed it would become more and more difficult to work with the Serb party that was led by Radovan Karadzic.</p>\n<p><em>Independence and War</em> <br />Almost a year would go by with the tense situation after the Serb unrest began in Knin and Krajina. What had many had foreseen would finally take place on 25 July 1991. Croatia and Slovenia declared independence from the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Belgrade responded in turn and deployed the federal Yugoslav People's Army. Two days later the Slovenian War of Independence began, also known as “the Ten Days War”. The war was over quickly. A ceasefire was concluded and Slovenia gained its independence while the Yugoslavian People’s Army (JNA) pulled out of the country. Things would not be quite so easy in Croatia. Here, Serbian Krajina declared independence and the JNA was at its gates in August before the Croats were able to assert control in the entire country. The fighting in Croatia was long and bloody. Towns like Dubrovnik and Split that had previously been popular tourist destinations were bombarded by artillery and Vukovar lay in ruins after a long siege.<br />The war was condemned by the international community. The UN Security Council adopted Resolution 713 (1991) in September, implementing a complete embargo on arms from anywhere in the former Yugoslavia. American Cyrus Vance was also appointed as special envoy in October and given the task of negotiating and restoring peace. After a number of attempts by the European Community it was finally possible to negotiate a sustainable ceasefire in the beginning of 1992, after which the UN Security Council (via Resolution 743 in 1992) set up a peacekeeping force called the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), which would be the first of many UN measures in the former Yugoslavia. Croatia and Slovenia were recognised by the EC and a number of other countries, but almost a third of Croatia was still occupied by the JNA and paramilitary forces from Serb Krajina.<br />In the meantime, tensions in Bosnia-Herzegovina had reached boiling point, partly as a result of the conflict in Croatia. With Slovenia and Croatia on their way out of the union and as Serb nationalism increased, Bosnian Croats and Muslims feared that they would be stuck in a Yugoslavia with no ability to counter the Serbs. In the Bosnian parliament Bosnian Muslims and Croats had discussed a memorandum about sovereignty and neutrality in the Croatian war, which led to Serb members of parliament walking out of parliament in October 1991. Autonomous Serb areas were established in Bosnia-Herzegovina during the autumn, similar to what had happened in Serb Krajina in Croatia, while Bosnian Croat areas in the western part of the country did the same. Each of the three ethnic groups in Bosnia-Herzegovina formed their own paramilitary forces at the same time. Serbs, Croats and Muslims. <br />Only a short time would pass after the ceasefire in Croatia entered into force before war broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina. After Slovenia and Croatia were recognised as independent states by the international community in 1992 an independence referendum was set in motion in Bosnia-Herzegovina. At the end of February it seemed that there was a large majority in favour of independence. The referendum was boycotted by the ethnic Serb groups and many people were prevented from voting in the autonomous Serb areas. Nonetheless, there was a majority in favour of independence. President Izetbegovic declared Bosnia-Herzegovinan independence on 3 March, the decision being ratified by parliament the same evening, Serbian MPs refusing to participate.</p>\n<p><em>Civil War in Bosnia</em> <br />Things would fall apart completely in Bosnia-Herzegovina during March. Fighting was reported in several places in the country during the weeks after independence was declared, with Bosnian Serbs who were sometimes supported by JNA troops, Krajina Serbs and groups from Serbia itself on one side and Bosnian Croats, Bosnian Muslims and armed Croats who had crossed the border on the other. The earliest days of the civil war were mostly characterised by a breakdown of law and order. The ethnic parties and their militias made attempts to fill a power vacuum and took control of strategically important locations to ensure a stronger position in future fighting.<br />Although massacres and the expulsion of populations based on “undesirable” ethnicity had already occurred during the war in Croatia, they fade in comparison to would be seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The first large massacre carried out by a paramilitary force from Serbian Bosnia-Herzegovina to receive media attention took place in the very beginning of April in the town of Bijeljina in the eastern part of the country. Large proportions of the Muslim population were murdered or expelled. Peace demonstrations in Sarajevo attended by participants from all the town’s ethnicities were fired upon by Bosnian Serbs.<br />Soon afterwards Bosnia-Herzegovina was recognised as an independent country by the EC, who were quickly followed by the USA. The country was already in a state of civil war by this point. It was decided on 15 April that an official Bosnia-Herzegovinan army would be created to combat the Bosnia-Herzegovina breakaway areas.<br />On the same day as Bosnia-Herzegovina’s independence was recognised by the EC, its capital Sarajevo was bombarded by Serb artillery. This would be the first bombardment in a siege that would last for years. The war proceeded across the country for the first year with Bosnian Serb military successes in spite of the fact that the Bosnian Croats and Muslims initially presented a united front. No matter who was the victor, a victory would often be followed by operations in which the “undesired” civilian population would be murdered or forced to flee the area. The siege of Sarajevo and ethnic cleansing elsewhere defined the brutality of this war and were largely the reason why attitudes in the global community became hostile to the Serbs.<br />The alliance between Croats and Muslims in Bosnia-Herzegovina collapsed in 1992 and the following year the war would become a war involving three different protagonists: 1) The official Bosnia-Herzegovina which was primarily comprised of Muslims and those who were unwilling to side with an ethnicity, 2) Bosnian Croats who were supported by Croat groups who crossed the border and 3) Bosnian Serbs with extensive support in Serbia and from the JNA until the army officially pulled out of Bosnia-Herzegovina in May 1992. Many JNA troops would subsequently, however, join one of the sides in the war. The most famous example of this is Ratko Mladic, a JNA officer who stayed in Bosnia-Herzegovina as the leader of the Bosnian Serb army and who would later be convicted of crimes against humanity. There was also a fourth military force in Bosnia-Herzegovina; the troops deployed by the UN to the various missions. UNPROFOR was created during the war in Croatia as a peacekeeping mission but was given an extended mandate to also cover Bosnia-Herzegovina. UNIPROFOR’s main objective for most of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was humanitarian and took the form of ensuring that emergency aid was able to get through to its destination. “Safe zones” would be set up later in 1993, where the UN was able to protect civilians and refugees. A naval blockade was imposed in 1992 which was expanded on an ongoing basis. A no-fly zone was enforced from the following year, as well as a NATO-led air campaign, initially in the form of air support for UN troops but ultimately carrying out bombardments of Bosnian Serb targets during 1995.</p>"

The tourist boom that followed in the second half of the 1980s put the city on the world map, attracting large numbers of visitors who came to see the beautiful combination of European and Ottoman architecture in the old district, where mosques and cathedrals stood side-by-side.

Although the referendum itself proceeded peacefully, taking into account the intense ethnic tensions in the country, a Serb wedding in the city was fired upon the day after the referendum, resulting in two fatalities. The following morning Serb groups had barricaded several streets in Serb-dominated neighbourhoods. After a cross-section of the city’s inhabitants protested for peace the situation became even more tense. Bosnia-Herzegovina's declared independence despite all of this.<br />Although fighting broke out in various parts of the country during March 1992, Sarajevo itself was relatively calm for most of the month. It was not until April that the years-long battle for the capital finally began. President Izetbegovic ordered the mobilisation of all police officers and reservists in Sarajevo on 4 April. On the same day the Bosnian Serb SDS party secretly advised all Serbs in the town to leave. Soon afterwards, on the same day as the country’s independence was recognised by the EC (6 April) the first artillery shells would be fired over the city, from the Serb-populated hillsides that surrounded the city.<br />Even though it would be a little longer before the city was surrounded, this was the beginning of the siege. The years-long siege of Sarajevo defined the brutality of this war and were largely the reason why attitudes in the global community became hostile to the Serbs. Lasting three years and four months, this was the longest a town had been under siege in modern history.</p>\n<p><em>The battle for Sarajevo’s airport</em> <br />The long siege of Sarajevo led to many fatalities, not just from artillery or sniper fire, but from hunger and disease as it was difficult to supply the hundreds of thousands of people who lived in the city with food and medicine. The Bosnian Serb forces made strong progress at the beginning of the civil war. With Sarajevo surrounded and under artillery bombardment the Serbs tried to take parts of the city by storm on 2 May, in an attempt to split the besieged areas in two. The attackers were repulsed, however, as the paramilitary “Green Beret” Muslim forces and the city’s mafia were able to stop the assault.<br />President Izetbegovic returned home the following day after attending peace negotiations in Lisbon. In the weeks leading up to this attack he had been demanding that the Yugoslav People's Army withdraw from the country or submit to the command of the civilian government. As the situation involving Izetbegovic and the JNA became increasingly hostile, JNA troops at Sarajevo’s barracks would be besieged inside the besieged city. Upon his arrival at the airport he was kidnapped by a group of JNA officers who intended to use him to guarantee free passage out of the city for all JNA troops. Despite the presence of a UNPROFOR escort and Izetbegovic himself, the JNA convoy was attacked by Bosnian Muslim paramilitary forces from the city. Although the number of fatalities was low, all parties left with a bitter taste in their mouths and regaining mutual trust would be difficult. <br />On 27 May 1992 people queueing for bread were hit during an artillery bombardment, with many civilian fatalities as a result. Three days later the UN Security Council imposed a number of sanctions against what remained of Yugoslavia. There were several other similar events during the siege, which turned attitudes against the Serbs. The JNA had in the meantime handed over Sarajevo’s airport to the Bosnian Serb forces who were besieging the city. Because of shortages of food and medicine supplies for the city’s civilians the UN attempted to negotiate the reopening of the airport to aircraft carrying humanitarian aid. This would become a crisis during June, when a ceasefire that was intended to allow the airport to be handed over to the UN was broken by both Muslims and Serbs. UN General secretary Boutrus-Ghali gave the Serb forces an ultimatum to hand the airport over to the UN within two days. Eventually the Serb forces handed the airport over to UNIPROFOR peacekeeping forces on 29 May. Although the siege of the city continued, supplies airlifted in the following year would be critical to the city’s population and the media were also able to enter the city and report on conditions.</p>\n<p><em>The Markale massacres</em> <br />Sarajevo was completely surrounded on several occasions, with all roads into the city blocked by the Bosnian Serb forces until negotiations led to control being assigned to UN troops, after which emergency aid convoys were able to enter the city. Artillery bombardments would impact international attitudes to the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina on multiple occasions, the attack on the bread queue leading to sanctions and international focus on the situation involving Sarajevo’s airport.<br />The two most critical attacks both hit an old market square in Sarajevo’s central Markale neighbourhood. On 5 February 1994 a mortar shell hit the busy market square during the early afternoon. Killing 68 and injuring 144 civilians, this was one of the bloodiest artillery bombardments of the war. Although there was uncertainty about who was responsible for the attack, it led to a harder approach by the international company to the Bosnian Serb siege of the city. NATO demanded that “exclusion zones” were established, no artillery positions being permitted around Sarajevo. It was also decided that NATO’s air power would be used to support UNPROFOR and to protect the UN.-guaranteed “safe zones” in Bosnia-Herzegovina. NATO combat aircraft were deployed just a few weeks later, shooting down four unidentified aircraft that breached the UN no-fly zone.<br />The same market square was again fired upon by artillery just over a year and a half later on 28 August 1995. 43 were killed and 75 injured during this attack and the massacres in Srebrenica followed soon after. NATO and the rest of the world’s patience with the Bosnian Serbs ran out. Although an air campaign had already been planned, this attack was the official justification for NATO’s full intervention in the war. Just two days after the attack NATO therefore commenced Operation Deliberate Force on 30 August. Aircraft from NATO countries carried out bombing raids on Bosnian Serb targets during the following month, the primary objective being to force them to the negotiating table to bring about peace and end the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. When a joint simultaneous offensive involving Bosnian Muslims and Croats pushed the Bosnian Serbs back, the international community was finally able to produce a peace agreement at Dayton in the USA.<br />Because of the offensive and the NATO air campaign a ceasefire was concluded in October 1995, after which Sarajevo again had water and electricity supplies. The siege of the city was not declared officially over until February 1996 when the last Bosnian Serb forces vacated their positions encircling the city.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>ATTEMPTED PEACE<br />There were numerous attempts to find a long-term solution to the conflicts that followed the breakup of Yugoslavia. As a particular consequence of the many expulsions and massacres that took place in Bosnia-Herzegovina a number of conferences were convened in 1994 and 1995 and a contact group was created to bring about a long-lasting peace after the war.<br />The first UN troops were deployed in the form of UNPROFOR during the Croatian war of independence. When the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina began the UN would quickly get involved, with a number of Security Council resolutions, including sanctions and arms embargoes, an extension to UNPROFOR’s mandate to include humanitarian aid in Bosnia-Herzegovina and eventually the creation of “safe zones”. European states represented the vast majority of UNPROFOR’s personnel in Bosnia-Herzegovina. After November 1993 the EC - EU would try for a long time to take the lead in peace negotiations. A permanent solution could not be found until NATO implemented Operation Deliberate Force - the actual air campaign against Bosnian Serb targets.</p>\n<p><em>Baby steps: 1992-1993.</em> <br />When the first unrest broke out in Bosnia-Herzegovina during the March 1992 referendum the UN was sceptical about the deployment of armed forces to the country. With the spread of the humanitarian crisis, the first massacres, the siege of Sarajevo and the shelling of people queuing for bread, the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina became the subject of serious concern from the international community, with subsequent sanctions against what remained of Yugoslavia and the continuation of an arms embargo. <br />A conference was held during the summer of 1992 at which the international community met the warring factions in the hope of bringing about an agreement. The various factions were still unwilling to engage with each other and no solution was possible. Instead, American Cyrus Vance was appointed by the UN and British Lord David Owen was appointed by the EC to continue negotiations and hopefully come up with a long-term solution. <br />The Vance-Owen plan that was put forward in January 1993 was the first large-scale proposed solution to be brought to the table. It proposed a federal Bosnia-Herzegovina with self-governing provinces divided on the basis of ethnicity. It was rejected by Bosnian Serbs as the peace plan would entail Serb withdrawal from large areas they had taken during the war. Cyrus Vance stepped down and was replaced by Norway's foreign minister, Thorvald Stoltenberg.<br />During the following period negotiations were conducted not only with Bosnian parties but also with Serb leaders from Yugoslavia and the Croatian government, who each supported their own part of the conflict. These negotiations resulted in the Owen-Stoltenberg plan, which proposed the division of the country into three zones, one for each of the ethnic groups. The proposal was rejected by Bosnia-Herzegovina's Muslim president Alija Izetbegovic, who was unwilling to move from a stance that the solution should leave Bosnia-Herzegovina as a country with no ethnic divisions. At the same time, the Serbs and Croats wanted to see Bosnia-Herzegovina divided up between Croatia and Serb-dominated Yugoslavia, with little thought for Bosnian Muslims.<br />In parallel to the various negotiations, attempts were also made to negotiate a number of local ceasefires. The ceasefires would quickly be broken and patience with the negotiations process evaporated. At the same time the common ground between Bosnian Croats and Muslims had broken down and all three factions were now warring against each other. The international community also found itself conflicted. The mainly European countries who had ground personnel in UNPROFOR were on one side, whereas the Americans, who were unwilling to participate in the mission until a long-term peace agreement had been negotiated, were on the other.</p>\n<p><em>Safe Zones and the Dual-key system.</em> <br />In addition to the UN and EC-led peace negotiations, the UN Security Council had in 1993 made resolutions to set up so-called “safe zones” in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The first of these was the town of Srebrenica, which was a refuge for many civilians as a result of fighting and ethnic cleansing in the region. General Morillon, the French commander-in-chief of the UN forces was the first to introduce the term “safe zones” when he arrived in the town and saw what conditions were like there. Srebrenica’s Muslim defenders were hard pressed by Bosnian Serb forces in the area, but agreed to disarm in exchange for assurances for security from UNPROFOR.<br />A number of other concentrated zones were set up during the time that followed: Zepa, Gorazde, Tuzla, Bihac and Sarajevo, the besieged capital. All these zones were in Muslim areas with large numbers of civilians who were threatened by Bosnian Serb forces or by the Serb area in Krajina. The safe zones would be under the control of UNPROFOR peacekeeping forces, distributing emergency aid to civilians and ensuring their safety. Although UNPROFOR personnel was seldom heavily armed or able to protect the areas against a determined attack, it was hoped that their mere presence would suffice to deter attacks and ensure safety for the badly-affected civilian population. It was not calm in the “safe zones”, however, as these were often areas from which Muslim forces were launching attacks on the Serbs, which would lead to incoming fire from the Bosnian Serb forces. The UN Security Council also set up a no-fly zone above Bosnia-Herzegovina and mandated NATO to enforce it. Resolution 836 (1993) mandated NATO aircraft to provide air support to UNPROFOR if ground forces were attacked.<br />Neither NATO or its ground forces had the final say when it came to authorising the deployment of NATO combat aircraft to provide air support. A so-called “Dual Key” system was in operation, which meant that UNPROFOR had to request air support, which then had to be approved by both NATO and the UN before pilots could be ordered to fire on a target. The intention here was that the use of force should remain in the UN’s hands, but in practice this was difficult to manage and often led to reaction times that were too slow to serve any useful purpose. When Bosnian Serb forces were attacked from the air it was seldom a deterrent. Instead, they began taking UNPROFOR soldiers as hostages in response to air attacks.</p>\n<p><em>Conferences about massacres</em>. <br />Negotiations began to make some progress in 1994. US president Bill Clinton was able to get the Croat and Bosnian Muslim leaders to meet and negotiate an initial ceasefire and then a federal structure. The Washington Agreement of 18 March 1994 was signed by Croatian president Tudjman and his counterpart from Bosnia, president Izetbegovic and brought one component of the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina to an end. It produced a federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s Muslims and Croats, who would then be able to form a united front against the Serbs.<br />The Contact Group was also set up the same year. When formal negotiations conducted by the EU, UN and OSCE had not led to peace, a more informal forum was created in the form of the Contact Group, partly as a consequence of the crisis that followed the attack on a marketplace in Sarajevo in February 1994. The group was comprised of the powers that had a strong influence in the Balkans: the USA, Russia, France, the United Kingdom and Germany who would jointly negotiate with the warring factions. Despite the rejection of its first proposal by Bosnian Serbs, the Contact Group continued to play an important negotiating role up to the final peace that was concluded in the Dayton Agreement of 1995.<br />The events in Srebrenica were pivotal to subsequent negotiations. The area surrounding Srebrenica was under the control of a Dutch UNPROFOR contingent after the town's Bosnian Muslims had disarmed. Bosnian Serbs attacked the town in spite of the UN presence. Despite its population being under UNPROFOR’s protection, the Dutch UN troops were overrun in July 1995 and air support was repeatedly refused, until a few bombs were eventually dropped. The bombs had little effect and not to a degree that was able to stop the advancing Bosnian Serbs who murdered men, raped women and burned houses on their way to the town. On the night of 12 July many people tried to flee the area on foot through the mountainous terrain to Tuzla, but were attacked en route, the vast majority ending up dead. In the town men and women were split up. The women and children were packed into buses and transported to the nearest Muslim area but the men were executed in fields, woods and warehouses at various locations in the town. Over 7,000 people lost their lives in the worst massacre in Europe since the Second World War. The Srebrenica massacre was a wound that would not heal in many countries, most notably in the Netherlands.<br />Because of these atrocities a new conference was convened in London. 16 nations met on 21 July to discuss how to proceed. Among other things, this led to the Dual Key system being scrapped, making NATO military command the sole decision-maker about when to provide air support. Agreement was also reached in principle about the option of carrying out a large-scale air campaign against the Bosnian Serbs if they continued to attack UN forces and persisted in their unwillingness to conclude a peace agreement. There was extensive focus at the conference on the crisis involving the Gorazde safe zone that was besieged by Bosnian Serb forces. During previous incidents at Gorazde NATO had only carried out so-called pinpoint attacks with the aim of deterring Bosnian Serbs. At the conference in London it was announced that a tougher approach had now been established and that the Americans were ready to deploy massive and overwhelming force. Shortly afterwards, on 1 August, NATO committed to the deployment of its air power, not only to protect Gorazde, but also Bihac (where the UN force had a Danish commander), Sarajevo and Tuzla.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>NATO AND DAYTON<br />In 1995 the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina had continued for three years and parts of Croatia were still under the control of the Republic of Serbian Krajina. Ethnic cleansing and attacks on civilian populations continued to horrify the entire world, while peace plan after peace plan was rejected by the various parties. This would be the last year of the war, however. The international community was no longer willing to stand by as the rules of war were violated, ceasefires were broken and UN peacekeepers were taken hostage.</p>\n<p><em>NATO's air operations.</em> <br />In Resolution 78 the UN Security Council had already set up a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1992. This would be expanded the following year with Resolution 816, which authorised UN member states to enforce the no-fly zone by military means. In practice, NATO would be responsible for enforcement as part of Operation Deny Flight, which led to the first shooting down of combat aircraft that violated the ban in February 1994.<br />During the same year several UN safe zones in Bosnia-Herzegovina were also attacked by Bosnian Serb forces. The town of Gorazde was besieged during the spring of 1994, despite its status as one of the safe zones. NATO carried out a number of bombing attacks on the advancing Bosnian Serbs to stop the attack. Although it slowed down the offensive it led to about 150 UNPROFOR soldiers being taken as hostages. Many were chained to potential NATO bombing targets to prevent them from being bombed. The Gorazde crisis was fortunately resolved through negotiations led by Yashushi Akashi, the personal representative of the UN's Secretary General, but the weakness of NATO and the UN was exposed for all to see. This would be far from the last time that UNPROFOR soldiers were taken hostage. Threats and actual hostage-taking were also used to prevent heavy bombing attacks when the Bosnian Serbs advanced upon Srebrenica. During the massacre that followed the Dutch soldiers in the town were taken as hostages to prevent NATO from taking measures and to prevent any involvement of UN forces. This situation caused deep scars in the Netherlands and exposed the UN’s impotence and lack of options.<br />Patience had almost run out. After the massacre in Srebrenica it was decided to increase options for extensive air attacks on Bosnian Serbs. UNPROFOR was also expanded and restructured to have a stronger and more mobile force that would be better able to withstand Bosnian Serb aggression. Patience finally ran out after civilians were again shelled at a marketplace in Sarajevo. NATO launched Operation Deliberate Force in 30 August 1995. This was a major bombing campaign against Bosnian Serbs that aimed to drag them to the negotiating table and finally bring the civil war to an end.</p>\n<p><em>The ground campaign</em> <br />1995 in Bosnia-Herzegovina actually began with a ceasefire that had been negotiated by former US president Jimmy Carter. It was broken on various occasions by both sides, but the first months of the year were relatively peaceful. The ceasefire was used to regroup, particularly by the Bosnian Muslim army that became a far stronger armed force than had been the case previously. After the previous year’s Washington Agreement, they now fought side by side with Bosnian Croats, supported by the Croatian army. Since the 1991 war of independence, the Croatian army had transitioned from militias and home guard units into a proper military, including with support from a number of western nations. The Bosnian Serbs, however, were now receiving less and less support from Milosevic’s Yugoslavia that was suffering under UN sanctions. Milosevic himself had also run out of patience with the Bosnian Serbs, who had even rejected the peace proposals that Milosevic himself had helped to negotiate.<br />Despite the UN presence in the form of United Nations Confidence Restoration Organization in Croatia (UNCRO in short), the Croatian army was able in two operations called ”Flash” and ”Storm” to defeat and expel/cleanse Krajina Serbs from most of Croatia. Croatia was thus therefore able to provide increased support to both Bosnian Croat and Muslim forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina and to deploy its own personnel to combat engagements. An important supply line was also opened to the Bihac pocket, which had long been besieged and under fire by Bosnian Serbs, despite its status as one of the UN’s “safe zones”.<br />The Bosnian Serbs who had won rapid victories earlier in the war and were unwilling to give up the smallest piece of ground in peace negotiations found themselves hard pressed by a combined Croat-Muslim offensive, simultaneous to the start of NATO's air campaign in the autumn of 1995. The Bosnian Serbs agreed to a ceasefire on 12 October 1995 and negotiations began soon after in Dayton, Ohio, where the final peace agreement was to be finalised.</p>\n<p><em>A peace agreement for Bosnia-Herzegovina</em>. <br />The civil war finally came to an end as 1995 drew to a close. Negotiations became possible after increased pressure form the international community in the form of the Contact Group and individual nations, while NATO’s air campaign and an offensive of Croats and Muslims were putting the Bosnian Serbs under military pressure. Although the war ended with the Dayton Agreement, it would not be the end of international commitments in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The post-war commitment was in fact greater than ever before, with the creation of new international missions to ensure implementation of the agreement and that the country got off to a reasonably stable start.</p>\n<p><em>The Dayton Agreement</em> <br />An actual NATO commitment in Bosnia-Herzegovina had long been difficult to set in motion because of disagreements between the European states that had contributed to UNPROFOR and the USA that wanted to lift the arms embargo and initiate an air campaign. The USA had opposed a peacekeeping mission as long as the war continued, but had changed its attitude, partly because of the fact that Croat and Muslim forces would be jointly able to combat the Bosnian Serbs. The international community had no longer been able to stand by after the massacre in Srebrenica and other attacks on civilians. Operation Deliberate Force, in combination with a land offensive in Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Muslim-Croat federation, resulted in a ceasefire on 12 October, after which negotiations could commence.<br />After weeks of back and forth diplomacy American vice foreign minister Richard Holbrooke was able to bring the parties to negotiations at an American air force base in Dayton, Ohio. Unlike previously, the Bosnian Serbs and Croats were not at the negotiating table. There were instead represented by Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic and Croatian president Franjo Tudmander who, together with Alija Izetbegovic the Muslim president of Bosnia-Herzegovina, would try to find a solution to the conflict. Of the three, only Izetbegovic favoured a unified state, whereas Tudjman and Milosevic wanted to divide Bosnia-Herzegovina’s Croat and Serb areas among themselves. After long, hard negotiations, during which Holbrooke was persistent despite opposing proposals and stubborn negotiators, and he would eventually achieve success. The compromise that was eventually reached was based on a plan that had previously been put forward by the Contact Group. Bosnia-Herzegovina became a single state, but a federation divided into two sub-states: a Serb republic in 49% of the country and a Croat-Muslim federation that was comprised of the remaining 51%. The division brought peace, but a divided country that largely reflected the war’s ethnic cleansing which had attempted to produce ethnically “pure” areas. The appendices of the Dayton Agreement also stipulated a number of requirements for issues such as the return home of refugees, how the political system would function with a three-way presidential office in which all groups were represented and an international high commissioner who would be able to dismiss politicians who worked counter to the agreement.</p>\n<p><em>IFOR and SFOR.</em> <br />When the Dayton Agreement was signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina was officially over. It had cost the lives of over 100,000 people and driven over half of the country’s population into flight, either as internally displaced persons or as refugees abroad. Two international missions were set up to implement the agreement and prevent the conflict from escalating again. These were known as IFOR and, later, SFOR. Both were under NATO command, most contributions coming from NATO countries but with participation from other states. Russia’s involvement was particularly important, as Russia had often stood alongside the Serbs during the conflict. The Russian contribution was therefore important if the international force was to be perceived as neutral. There were also contributions form a number of Muslim states. The collaboration between Russian and NATO troops was considered an important step towards a peaceful future, just a few years after the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.<br />IFOR or Implementation Force was the first of the international missions that followed the Dayton Agreement. As its name implies, its purpose was to monitor the implementation of the agreement and ensure that things proceeded in a peaceful manner. Its role was initially to keep the two warring sides apart with a demilitarised strip through the country dividing the two sub-states. IFOR and its successors were also to help with the arrest of individuals who were to be prosecuted for war crimes and to provide general support for the international political commitment in the country. The mission commenced under NATO command on 20 December 1995 soon after the Dayton Agreement was signed. Almost 60,000 soldiers took part in IFOR. About 1,600 Danes were deployed to the force as part of a joint Nordic-Polish brigade called NORDPOLBDE, in almost the same area as that for which the Nordic UNPROFOR contingent had been responsible.<br />IFOR was only present in Bosnia-Herzegovina for a year, after which its missions were assigned to SFOR, or Stabilization Force. After the calm election of a new government in September 1996 it was assessed that the peace had been implemented, but that the presence of an international force was still required in Bosnia-Herzegovina to ensure stability. SFOR’s initial deployment numbered 32,000 personnel, i.e. just over half that of IFOR but this would be downscaled as the peace was assessed to be more and more stable and after Bosnia-Herzegovina’s own police and military were able to take charge of several of SFOR's responsibilities. SFOR was officially wound down after eight years. Its missions were assigned to the EU on 2 December 2004, when a joint European force was deployed.</p>"

This was the culmination of a longer process that would once again involve the EU in the peace process, over a decade after the breakup of Yugoslavia. The states of the former Yugoslavia are now more or less stable, some even having become members of the EU. A number of EU missions continue in the Balkans, however, in which NATO continues to work in Bosnia-Herzegovina via the EU.</p>\n<p><em>Early EC and EU commitments in Yugoslavia</em><br />At the beginning of the wars in Yugoslavia the then EC led attempts to resolve the crisis through negotiations. Many saw this partly as a conflict in the EC's own back yard and partly that it was necessary for Europe to deal with the conflict on its own behalf. The EC had to be able to show the world that it was able to assume the role of a new international stakeholder who could occupy an increased role in the new world order after the fall of the Soviet Union. The EC tried to resolve the conflict during the war in Croatia, which did not come to an end until after a peace plan had been formulated by a special UN envoy, however. European states were at the forefront of moves to recognise Croatia and Slovenia and independent states in January 1992. This was important in terms of disassociating the war from what still remained of Yugoslavia and making it an internal conflict between the Krajina Serbs and Croatia.<br />The UNPROFOR peacekeeping force that was initially deployed in Croatia and then in Bosnia-Herzegovina was a UN project. European states provided most of UNPROFOR’s personnel and the EC still had a special envoy alongside the UN representative, who was at the forefront of negotiations between the protagonists of the Bosnian conflict. The Contact Group was also supported by the EU, with representation from the United Kingdom, France and Germany that constituted three fifths of its membership. Many of the group’s meetings were also observed by representatives of various EU institutions.<br />As such, the EU was not responsible for ending the war. It was instead the Contact Group’s plan that formed the basis for the final US-sponsored Washington Agreement that brought two of the protagonists together. NATO and its many EU members carried out the air campaign which finally brought the last remaining party to the negotiating table. The EU continued to be represented during negotiations and the final signature of the Dayton Agreement in Paris (at the request of the French president) took place with the EU as official witness.</p>\n<p><em>EUFOR.</em><br />Both IFOR and SFOR were provided with large proportions of their personnel by EU member states but were officially NATO missions. SFOR was wound down on 2 December 2004. The EU officially took over in the form of European Force Althea (or EUFOR Althea in short) that would carry out its missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The transfer was largely symbolic, as about 80% of SFOR personnel continued under EUFOR Althea. This mission has been responsible for the international contribution in Bosnia-Herzegovina since 2004 and is still active at the time of writing. Its primary missions are to train the Bosnian army, continue hunting war criminals, providing support to the international high commissioner in the country and thus ensure continued compliance with the Dayton Agreement.<br />There was also a military EU mission in Macedonia, called EUFOR Concordia. Fighting broke out in 2001 between the Macedonian government army and separatists from the country’s large Albanian minority. Macedonia had otherwise managed to get through Yugoslavia’s breakup relatively peacefully, but the large number of Albanian refugees from the 1999 Kosovo conflict had increased tensions between the Albanian minority and the Macedonian state and large numbers of arms had arrived in the country after the fighting in Kosovo. The EU-sponsored Ohrid Agreement officially brought the fighting in Macedonia to an end and a NATO force was initially deployed to monitor the peace that followed. This role was transferred to EUFOR Concordia on 31 March 2003, which has since contributed to creating a safe and stable environment for the implementation of the Ohrid Agreement.</p>\n<p><em>EU Police Missions</em><br />The EU has also been involved in a number of police-related missions to the countries that emerged from the former Yugoslavia. Their purpose has been to help with the performance of police duties and, in particular, to train the local police corps. Places like Bosnia-Herzegovina had seen an almost total collapse of law an order and the war had led to extensive “black markets” and corruption. The EUPM/BiH or European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina was therefore set up and had an active presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1 January 2003 until 31 December 2011.<br />The EU police missions have also provided support to Macedonia, initially in the form of EUPM Proxima, which worked alongside EUFOR Concordia from 2003 to 2005. After 2005 there was a half-year deployment of police officers from the EU in the form of EUPAT – European Union Police Advisory Team, which continued to advise the local police force.</p>\n<p>T<em>he former Yugoslavia in the present day</em><br />At the time of writing the many conflicts have been either resolved or put on ice. Slovenia and Croatia have gained membership of the EU. Serbia, Montenegro, Albania, Macedonia, Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina are at various stages of the route towards membership of the EU or NATO or are perhaps already members, provisional upon reforms etc. for several of them.<br />Many of Yugoslavia’s former republics continue to maintain close relationships with each other in which they are each other’s biggest trading partners and have a number of mutual agreements. The terrible fighting of the 1990s has not been forgotten, however. Bosnia-Herzegovina continues to be divided into Serb and Croat-Muslim sub-states and Serbia refuses to acknowledge Kosovo despite it having gained independence. The economy is struggling in many of the countries and the process of rebuilding the broken countries has been difficult. Despite all this there has been peace for many years. Relationships between most states are normalised and the contributions provided by the UN, NATO and EU have helped to bring increased stability to the Balkans over the last decade and hopefully for years to come.</p>"

Since its first deployment in 1953, the Danish Emergency Management Agency’s employees and materials have provided and continue to provide a large contribution in close collaboration with other aid organisations (e.g. Red Cross and DanChurchAid) and international organisations (such as the UN and EU). The missions have been very diverse, including transportation, emergency aid, hospitals, providing drinking water, advisory services, pumping water away after floods, support during epidemics, building refugee camps etc. You can read about what was involved in each deployment by clicking on each mission. You will be surprised how many different missions we have been involved with.</p>"

The transition of the Belgian Congo from being a colony to being an independent state took place quite suddenly in June 1960. The Congolese people lacked the resources necessary to govern a country of 2.3 million square kilometres (1.2 million square miles) – four times the size of France. As a result, chaotic conditions affected the population of about 13 million including 140,000 whites. Separatist groups declared independence for the province of Katanga, giving rise to hostilities between separatists and the newly formed Congolese army, Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC), whose practices included mutiny, murder, and looting. The conflict worsened after several attacks on the remaining Belgian civilians and troops. Belgium then intervened militarily in the crisis in July 1960 by deploying 12,000 ground troops.<br />Under these circumstances, the Congolese government on July 12 requested assistance from the UN to counter foreign aggression. <br />Moise Tshombe, Mobutu, Lumumba, Dag Hammarskjöld, and the Luba peoples became familiar names during this period.</p>"

The goal of the mission was to maintain law and order, provide technical assistance to the inexperienced Congolese government, train the Congolese army and police force, and persuade the separatist groups to reverse their secession. The mandate was expanded in February and November 1961 to include protection of the political and territorial integrity of Congo, prevent civil war, and ensure the removal of all foreign troops not under UN command – including mercenaries and paramilitary forces – if necessary by using military power as a last resort. With this expanded mandate, the UN mission changed from being a peacekeeping effort into exercising a peace enforcement function. <br />During this mission, UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld perished in an aviation accident.</p>"

During the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Kosovo was at first relatively peaceful, but in 1996 a conflict broke out between the paramilitary group the Kosovo Liberation Army (UCK) and Serbian police and military in the area. As was happening elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia, the war was characterised by attacks on civilians and ethnic cleansing. As a consequence, NATO initiated airborne attacks on Serbian targets in March 1999 in an attempt to stop the conflict and force the Serbian-Yugoslavian forces to withdraw from Kosovo.<br />A large proportion of the population, from both the Serbian and the Kosovo-Albanian areas, had already fled because of the armed engagements and numerous attacks on civilians. The fighting and Serbian deportations of civilian Kosovo-Albanians meant that neighbouring Albania and Macedonia were, during the spring of 1999, receiving refugee numbers that had not been seen in Europe since the Second World War. The two already-poor countries therefore had problems guaranteeing refugees’ living conditions and safety and performing civilian emergency aid work.</p>\n<p> </p>"

Based on the Albanian request, the Danish Parliament considered this deployment an international collaboration that was based on a national agreement. Military force should only be applied to ensure safety, the free movement of the force itself and in the event of emergencies. The UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) accepted an offer from NATO in April to provide military support for their work to aid refugees from Kosovo who had fled to Albania and Macedonia.<br />The Danish Emergency Management Agency contributed to aiding the humanitarian disaster by sending personnel to perform many different tasks and missions (see Danish Emergency Management Agency, Albania 1999).</p>"

While Serbian President Slobodan Milošević was in power, the Serbian parliament revoked this independent status in 1989. During the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s, Kosovo was at first relatively peaceful, but in 1996 a conflict broke out between the paramilitary group the Kosovo Liberation Army and Serbian police and military in the area.<br />In February 1998, the conflict in Kosovo escalated, and as in other parts of Yugoslavia, attacks on civilians and ethnic cleansing were common. Thousands of refugees spilled into neighbouring countries. NATO stationed military forces to maintain security and provide humanitarian aid. Although the UN Security Council urged cessation of hostilities, the conflict was not resolved by diplomatic means. The Yugoslav government refused to accept NATO personnel as peacekeepers as it was feared that doing so would give rise to an independent nation of Kosovo. The view in Belgrade was that Western nations had had a hand in the loss of Yugoslav territories in other parts of Yugoslavia near the existing UN missions in the area.<br />After several rounds of international negotiations, particularly in Rambouillet in France, it was realised in March 1999 that the conflict could not be resolved by diplomatic means. At that time, NATO had assembled an air force for the purpose of putting pressure on the Yugoslav government, and shortly after the breakdown of negotiations, it was deployed on missions in Kosovo and Serbia.</p>"

Still, it was hoped that a diplomatic resolution would be possible. The air campaign did not start until March of the following year (1999) when the negotiations had broken down.<br />Although this activity was based on Resolution 1199 (1998), the resolution did not provide a mandate for a regular military intervention. However, NATO still decided to proceed with the operation when President Slobodan Milošević refused to accept the Rambouillet accord that was supposed to put an end to hostilities. That was the first time military operations were carried out by NATO without a clear mandate from the UN. For that reason, the operation was met with significant international criticism. The NATO view, however, was that in light of the ethnic cleansing, there was an obligation to intervene in order to force Milošević to accept an accord that would end the conflict and prevent further attacks on civilians and thus ensure compliance with the UN resolution.<br />The Supreme Allied Commander in Europe requested that Denmark contribute four F-16 fighter jets to the overall effort.</p>"

In this proposal, the government stressed the humanitarian crisis, the fact that Yugoslavia did not comply with UN resolutions, the fact that the conflict might impact the overall security situation in the region, and the fact that military force would be used only when all diplomatic avenues had been pursued. <br />Quite a debate ensued as this contribution would be the first deployment of the Danish armed forces without a UN mandate. Opponents of the proposal pointed out, among other things, that the humanitarian problem could not be solved with bombers. It was stated in addition that without a clear mandate from the UN, any action would constitute an attack without legitimacy in international law – and thus would undermine the international system. Furthermore, it was pointed out that no intervention had been made in the Algerian Civil War or in Sri Lanka. Supporters of the proposal stressed that efforts were being made to issue a UN resolution and that the only reason for the Security Council not to issue a direct mandate for military intervention was Russia’s veto power. The majority of political parties were of the opinion that it was necessary to set an example to demonstrate that ethnic cleansing of a country’s population by its own government is unacceptable. Experience from Bosnia, where military force or the threat of it had been necessary, was felt to be relevant. The discussion whether fighter jets would be able to bring peace took up much of the debate, and it was stated that in all likelihood ground troops would be necessary at a later stage. <br />Proposal B4 was dealt with on an urgent basis in Parliament, and it was approved the following day, 8 October 1998, with 92 votes in favour and 28 votes opposed.

Then, the UN Security Council approved Resolution 1244 (1999) to establish the Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo. On 10 June, the Serbian soldiers and police officers left Kosovo to let international forces take over. Denmark provided military personnel for this mission as well. Additional information is presented in the material on KFOR (Kosovo Force).<br />To ensure that Milošević complied with the agreement, three Danish F-16 jets with pilots and support personnel remained in Italy as part of a NATO force that was available also to support the operations in Bosnia.

NATO was criticised several times for hitting non-military targets in Serbia. In particular, the bombing of a Yugoslav TV station and the Chinese embassy in Belgrade drew significant criticism and created tensions between NATO, Russia, and China. <br />For security reasons, jets were not permitted to land on the Italian Grazzanise Air Base or on the aircraft carriers used as bases by other nations if they were carrying live bombs and missiles. Therefore, special dump zones were designated in the Adriatic Sea between Italy and the Balkan Peninsula. Ordnance was dropped here on the way back from a mission to Kosovo or Serbia. Later, NATO initiated <em>Operation Allied Harvest</em> with vessels to perform mine clearance and prevent live ordnance from floating freely. Here, too, Denmark took part with two ships from the Royal Danish Navy.<br />For most of the operation, the Danish jets were used primarily for escorts and air defence. At a later time, the Danish squadron was deployed in more aggressive operations, attacking Serbian ammunition depots, radar installations, and command centres in Kosovo. This was the first time the Royal Danish Air Force took active part in acts of war.<br />As a matter of interest, the allied bombardment of Serbian forces in 1995 lasted for 3-4 days while this operation lasted 80 days.</p>"

The purpose was to force it to leave Kosovo and to comply with UN Security Council Resolution 1199 (1998). The NATO campaign and the Danish contribution to it were referred to as Operation Allied Force.<br />To be safe, it was undesirable to land the aircraft with live bombs if these had not been dropped in Serbia and Kosovo.

He never officially became president, but he ruled the country as “Brotherly Leader and Guide of the Revolution” and claimed that it was a democracy governed by the people. The large oil reserves in the country enabled him to develop the country into one of the richest in the region, but he also devoted huge resources to the support of African dictators, Palestinian resistance groups, and the like. He is believed to have masterminded several terrorist attacks on Europe and the United States during the 1970s and 1980s.<br />In December 2010, demonstrations were held in neighbouring Tunisia to protest widespread corruption and the authoritarian regime. Large protests ensued and spread through the entire region as the “Arab Spring”. Demonstrations were held in Libya as well, but unlike the dictators in Tunisia and Egypt who resigned as a result of the popular uprisings, Gaddafi remained and ordered the military to crack down hard on any resistance. Some units of the army refused to fire at civilians, and before long the country was divided. An eastern part was led by demonstrators out of the city of Benghazi, and a western part was led by Gaddafi’s loyal soldiers out of the capital city of Tripoli.<br />During February, this situation developed into a regular civil war between the National Transitional Council of Libya, supported by military deserters and volunteers, and Gaddafi with the bulk of the country’s armed forces. On 22 February 2011, in a speech televised live, he described the rebels as rats and cockroaches and gangs of drunken drug addicts and swore to have anyone hanged who so much as raised a hand in protest against his regime. He succeeded in a brief offensive shortly thereafter, and his soldiers were closing in on Benghazi. In the international community, there were fears of a genocide in the event the forces loyal to the government were to occupy the city.</span></p>"

It was hoped that support could be given to the rebels by preventing Gaddafi from using the air force and thus giving them a chance to defend themselves.<br />France, the UK, and Lebanon – as a representative of the Arab League – then made a proposal to the UN Security Council that became Resolution 1973 (2011). The resolution was adopted on 17 March with no opposing votes and few abstentions. Several sanctions were imposed on the Libyan regime. The most important sanction was the request that the international community establish a no-fly zone over the country and protect civilians by any means possible except deployment of occupation forces in Libya.</span></p>"

In the proposal, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs interpreted the UN authorisation to protect civilians by any means possible to mean that a no-fly zone in itself cannot prevent attacks, and it requested authorisation to carry out air strikes against Libyan government forces. Comments on and questions about the proposal focused on a reluctance to deploy troops and on a desire to put pressure on the Gaddafi regime to accept a ceasefire and a peaceful resolution of the conflict. In addition, there was some concern about future developments in light of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />The proposal was dealt with on an urgent basis due to the seriousness of the situation. Introduced on 18 March, it was approved the following day with 110 votes in favour (all parties in Parliament). <br />On 30 March, however, the unity ended when the Red-Green Alliance withdrew its support of the mission. The Red-Green Alliance was of the opinion that while the UN had issued a mandate to prevent attacks on civilians, direct air support of the uprising would constitute participation in the civil war. </span></p>"

The operation grew in step with the movement of hostilities and came to include air missions in the entire country when the rebels had liberated larger areas.

It is a political party as well as a heavily armed militia.

Although Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, smaller skirmishes have erupted between Hezbollah and Israel several times.<br /></span><span>In the morning of 12 July 2006, Hezbollah fired rockets across the border and attacked an Israeli convoy, taking two soldiers hostage for later use in a prisoner exchange.  This led to a confrontation between Israeli military and the Hezbollah militia in Lebanese territory. Starting with bombs and rockets being fired across the border, it developed over the summer into an all-out invasion by Israeli soldiers and tanks into southern Lebanon. The Israeli government on several occasions stated that it was not in its view at war with the state of Lebanon, only with terrorists from Hezbollah inside Lebanon; yet government buildings and many civilian areas took serious hits, just as Hezbollah rockets did not distinguish between military and civilian targets in Israel.</span></p>"

                        "text": "<p><span>During the Lebanese Civil War, the Palestinian organisation PLO used Lebanon as a base for launching attacks on Israel. At the same time, Israel often attacked PLO positions in southern Lebanon with artillery and missiles. Subsequent to a major PLO action in March 1978, the Israeli army launched Operation Litani and occupied the entire southern part of Lebanon up to the Litani River aside from a small enclave around the city of Tyre. The next day, the Lebanese government submitted a protest to the UN Security Council over the invasion.<br />The first <em>UNIFIL</em> mission was then set up on the basis of UN Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426.  As a priority, Israel was ordered to cease all military action in Lebanon and to withdraw from that country. <em>UNIFIL</em> was established to ensure that the Israeli withdrawal did in fact take place, to maintain international peace and security in southern Lebanon, and to assist the Lebanese government in reasserting its authority over the area. The Israelis stayed put, and the Palestinian and certain Lebanese militias did not recognise the Israeli occupation or the <em>UNIFIL </em>mandate. Fighting continued. Later, Resolution 427 was approved. It increased the size of the mission to 6,000 men from 4,000, and the UN reiterated the order that all Israeli soldiers were to leave Lebanon. The ”I” in <em>UNIFIL</em> stood for <em>”Interim”</em> – in other words, the hope was that it would be a short engagement and not a permanent presence that might get involved in the civil war. The UN Security Council since then has renewed the mandate as the mission could not be considered complete. This effort has since been named <em>UNIFIL I.</em> Denmark contributed 6 officers in 1978 when the mission started. They assisted in building the mission headquarters in Naqoura. <em>UNTSO</em> (UN Truce Supervision Organization) already had a presence in the region and provided these officers on loan. Denmark’s participation in <em>UNIFIL I</em> did not last long. When Israel withdrew from the occupied area in the summer of 1978, control was transferred not to <em>UNIFIL</em> but rather to an allied militia. Israel continued to supply weapons to this militia, its representative in the Lebanese Civil War.</span></p>\n<p><span>When an assassination attempt was directed at an Israeli diplomat, Israel again invaded Lebanon on 6 June 1982. This time, the Israeli occupation culminated in a siege of the capital city of Beirut. The occupation continued even though an international agreement led PLO to leave Lebanon and go to Tunisia instead. After the massacres at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps, massive international pressure caused the Israelis to withdraw. However, the Israeli army and allied militias maintained a so-called security zone in southern Lebanon where <em>UNIFIL</em> was operating. The Shiite movement Hezbollah now arose as a resistance group opposing the continued Israeli presence in the country.<br /></span><span>The Lebanese Civil War ended officially with the Taif Agreement in 1989. Through this agreement, all militias were disarmed except Hezbollah. This group was regarded in Lebanon as a resistance movement against the occupation of southern Lebanon more than as a militia participating in the civil war. The Israeli security zone remained in Lebanon, in spite of attacks from Hezbollah, until Israel withdrew in 2000 without coordinating this move with the Lebanese government or <em>UNIFIL</em>. The situation remained tense, with isolated attacks across the border in a continuing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.<br />In the morning of 12 July 2006, Hezbollah launched rockets across the border and attacked an Israeli convoy, taking two soldiers hostage. They were likely to be used in a prisoner exchange. This incident caused a major conflict that developed over the summer into an all-out invasion by Israeli soldiers and tanks into southern Lebanon. The Israeli government on several occasions stated that it was not in its view at war with the state of Lebanon, only with terrorists from Hezbollah inside Lebanon; yet government buildings and many civilian areas took serious hits, just as Hezbollah rockets did not distinguish between military and civilian targets in Israel.</span></p>"

The primary objective of the resolution was to end the fighting by requesting that Israel withdraw its military from Lebanon and to expand the <em>UNIFIL</em> force to 15,000 personnel. This expanded effort is known as <em>UNIFIL II</em>. As was the case previously, the international force was to move in and secure the area around the so-called Blue Line until the Lebanese army could assume control of southern Lebanon. In addition, the force was to remain in the country to prevent renewed fighting between Hezbollah and Israel and to act as liaison and coordinator between Israel and the Lebanese government.<br />An embargo was to be set up so as to prevent arms materiel from entering the county over and above the amount authorised by the Lebanese government. This was an attempt to disarm Hezbollah or at least prevent its acquisition of new materiel.<br /><em>UNIFIL</em> has a mandate to use force in carrying out its tasks and in ensuring that it is free to move around and generally is safe.</span></p>"

These immigrants became an upper class that dominated Liberia and its population. The party of the elite ruled the country without interruption from 1877 to 1980, as the country’s original inhabitants were not given voting rights. Liberia’s political instability started in 1980, with the assassination of President Tolbert and several members of the government. The following period was characterised by instability and decline. On Christmas Eve 1989 a guerilla group called “the National Patriotic Front of Liberia” (NPFL) crossed the border from neighbouring Sierra Leone. Fighting between the guerilla groups and the army developed into an ethnic conflict between different population groups. Civilian populations were attacked and thousands fled to neighbouring countries. During the summer of 1990 Charles Taylor’s forces had gained control of most of Liberia and murdered President Doe. A peace treaty was not concluded until July 1993 with the participation of the UN and the Economic Community of West African States (<em>ECOWAS)</em>, but the prospect of peace was distant. The elections in July 1997 saw Charles Taylor winning with a 75% share of the vote. The peace was short-lasting and new unrest erupted, leading to the elimination of political rivals and the appearance of new rebel groups. </span>T<em>he United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL)</em> was a<span> UN </span>mission established in<span> </span>1993 and headquartered in the capital Monrovia. <em>UNOMIL</em> was created as part of the Cotonou Agreement to support the efforts of ECOWAS in Liberia during the First Liberian Civil War<span> </span>1989–1996.

ECOWAS troops were already present in Liberia and became part of the UN force, which was named <em>United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).</em> A number of Danish staff officers and observers were deployed between 2003 and 2010. The last remaining Danish officer departed Liberia in January 2016. In June that same year, the responsibility for Liberia’s national security was transferred to the country’s own national security forces. </span></p>"

This invasion was the first major international crisis after the end of the Cold War.<br />The invasion was widely condemned internationally. When a former Iraq ally, the Soviet Union, no longer desired to confront the U.S., Iraq did not have any support in the UN Security Council. A total of 12 resolutions were approved between August and November 1990. They demanded that the Iraqi occupation must end and imposed a series of sanctions against Iraq. This all culminated in Resolution 678 (1990) demanding that all Iraqi forces leave Kuwait by 15 January 1991. Should this demand not be met, the resolution authorised all countries, in collaboration with the government of Kuwait, to use any means necessary to get the Iraqi forces out of Kuwait.<br />When Saddam Hussein refused to comply and maintained the occupation of Kuwait, a coalition led by the U.S. initiated air raids on Iraqi forces on the day after the deadline. Thus began the First Gulf War. The ground war started on 24 February, and Kuwait was liberated on 28 February. Denmark participated in the Gulf War as a part of the international coalition by sending a corvette.<br /></span><span>A formal ceasefire was entered into on 3 April 1991 on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution 687 (1991).</span></p>"

They grew more serious during the spring of 1958, and by May the situation approached a civil war with large areas in the northern part of the country being out of reach of the government.

Patrols were carried out on the roads leading into the country. In addition, permanent observation posts were set up by the major roads as bases for the patrols. Surveillance of the area was carried out by air as well.<br /></span><span>The mission soon ran into difficulty performing this task. At the outset of the operation, opposition groups at first were unconvinced that the mission was impartial. Hence it took over a month to persuade the opposition that the mission was in fact impartial so as to gain access to the relevant areas.<br />There were further complications ahead for the mission. The union of Egypt and Syria had given revolutionary and nationalist groups in the region a boost. A coup was staged on 14 July 1958 to overthrow the monarchy in Iraq. This was hailed by the opposition in Lebanon with street celebrations and escalating attacks on the government army. As the United Arab Republic and the revolutionaries in Iraq were supported by Russia, President Chamoun invoked the American Eisenhower Doctrine committing assistance to countries under threat from international communism. More than 10,000 American marines arrived in Beirut in the following days to ensure that the Lebanese government remained in power and did not fall into the control of the new union. Jordan, too, experienced unrest, and like Lebanon it complained to the UN about meddling in its internal affairs by the United Arab Republic. The UN Security Council could not reach a consensus on the matter. Jordanian royalty instead requested British assistance. The British sent parachute troops to Jordan.</span></p>\n<p><span>Once more the observers found it difficult to prove impartiality as the American intervention raised questions as to the intent behind sending foreign troops to Lebanon. Still, some degree of trust on the part of the opposition was achieved, and access was given to the relevant border areas. No signs were found that a coordinated effort was being made to supply arms; rather local armed groups were moving back and forth in the border area.<br />Revolutions and Western interventions led to a series of meetings in the UN Security Council and General Assembly dealing with the crisis in the Middle East. However, no solution was found that would satisfy the Soviet Union and the United States and resolve the situation on the ground. In the end, the Lebanese themselves found a resolution to the crisis in Lebanon. Parliament appointed General Fuad Shihab to the presidency. He hailed from the largest inter-religious group in the country and was already known as a man of compromise. Earlier in the year, he had attempted to keep the military neutral when fighting broke out. Given that the conflict had been triggered in part by President Chamoun’s election fraud and his attempts to modify the constitution, the situation calmed down when Shihab took office, especially when he set up a government with opposition leaders in key positions under the slogan “no winner, no loser”.<br />The last <em>UNOGIL</em> report dated 17 November 1958 stated that as there was peace in Lebanon and there were normal relations with neighbouring countries, the mandate had been completed.</span></p>"

Driven by the national aspirations of Zionism and increasing attacks on Jews in the time between the two world wars, many European Jews immigrated to Palestine. The Palestinians often felt unfairly treated by the British authorities, and the immigrant Jews typically had better financial support and more resources with which they purchased land. Considerable unrest occurred in the years 1936-1939, most often as Palestinian protests that at times ended up in attacks on the Jewish residents and the British soldiers.<br />During World War II and in the years immediately following, there was considerable immigration to Palestine of Jews having escaped or survived the Holocaust. Given the events in Europe, there was a strong desire to create a Jewish state with charge of its own security in the future. Zionist paramilitary organisations were set up, and an armed campaign of bombing and guerrilla attacks was launched against the British forces.<br />As the large colonies in India and elsewhere were being relinquished, the British view was that it made little sense to retain the Middle East possession. When in the summer of 1946 a bombing attack was aimed at the largest hotel in Jerusalem, the British government looked for a way out.<br />By 1947, the British government handed over control of the area to the newly constituted United Nations and announced its departure from the area on 14 May 1948 regardless what happened. In an effort to prevent anarchy and war, the UN struck a working group named UNSCOP (United Nations Special Committee on Palestine) for the purpose of finding a solution. This group worked out a partition plan that was approved later that year by the UN General Assembly. The plan was heavily criticised, particularly by the Palestinians and other Arab states, because it allocated 55% of the land to Israel in spite of the fact that the Israelis made up only a third of the population and owned just 20% of the fertile land in the area.<br />The situation in Palestine now resembled a civil war, and attacks on civilians were common. In particular, the April massacre in the Palestinian village of Deir Yassin stirred fear in the Palestinian population. Many now fled. On the day after the departure of the British, Israel was proclaimed an independent nation on 15 May 1948. The Arab nations of Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Jordan refused to recognise Israel and attacked it in spite of the fact that Israel had been authorised and established by the UN.</span></p>"

At this time, military observers were sent to Palestine to check that the ceasefire was respected. This was the first ever peacekeeping mission with the name <em>UN Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO)</em>undertaken by the UN.<br />The Security Council decided to expand the mandate by Resolution 73 (1949) while agreements were being negotiated by Israel, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt. This expanded the scope of the mission and moved the observers from their single headquarters in Jerusalem to several positions in neighbouring Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Egypt. As a result, <em>UNTSO</em> had a presence in five countries in the region. At the same time, the mission was given greater independence from the UN and its peace negotiators. It thus became an independent entity led by a military chief of staff.<br />The security Council subsequently approved a number of resolutions in light of the fact that wars and unrest did not end with the ceasefires in 1949. However, the fundamental mandate and structure of <em>UNTSO </em>as an independent and unarmed observer mission has not been altered substantially.</span></p>"

A total of 1,300 Danes served in <em>UNTSO </em>since Denmark committed to the mission in 1948. In addition, Denmark has made contributions to related missions such as <em>United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF</em><strong>)</strong> in which Danish soldiers after the Suez war in 1956 kept Egyptian, British, and Israeli soldiers separate in the areas of Port Said and Gaza.<br /><em>UNTSO</em> has operated permanently since 1948, and its personnel has often been called upon to step in when the UN set up observation missions elsewhere, especially in nearby areas.

From a headquarters in Jerusalem, mediation was attempted between the parties, and proposals were put forward for peace agreements to replace the ceasefire proposal stemming from UN Security Council Resolution 50 (1948). The first mediation attempt failed, and a second proposal was rejected as members of a Zionist militant group in September murdered Swedish Count Folke Bernadotte who had been appointed by the UN to take charge of the mediation process. When the ceasefire expired shortly thereafter, fighting continued. As Israel got its footing, <em>UNTSO </em>in 1949 negotiated ceasefires between Israel and each of its neighbouring countries.<br />In the following year, the primary task for the mission was to ensure that agreements were kept and to mediate between the parties in case of e.g. border crossings or other problems. Observation posts were set up along the borders, and offices were set up, in addition to the headquarters in Jerusalem, in Gaza, Amman, Beirut, Damascus, and Ismailia in Egypt. The UN tasks were made more difficult when during the wars of 1956, 1967, and 1973 there were not always ceasefires to observe. Still <em>UNTSO</em> has been extended several times as it acted in a meditating capacity and attempted to keep minor incidents from escalating. Egypt in 1979 initiated a peace process with Israel, and since then peace agreements have been made among Israel, Egypt, and Jordan. The Amman post was therefore closed. The Egyptian post in Ismailia then focused on the Suez Canal, Sinai, and Gaza.<br />Today, <em>UNTSO</em> continues to work on monitoring compliance with ceasefires and other agreements among the countries in the region. It is still active in attempts to find a peaceful solution to the strife in the Israeli-occupied areas in Palestine. In addition, there is close collaboration with other local missions such as <em>UNIFIL</em>. Today, as in the beginning, <em>UNTSO </em>has headquarters in Jerusalem and branch offices in Beirut and Damascus. A number of smaller offices and observation posts in other towns and locations near the border were set up, such as <em>Observer Group Golan (OGG</em>) in the Golan Heights between Syria and Israel, and <em>Observer Group Lebanon</em> (<em>OGL</em>) on the border between Israel and Lebanon.</span></p>"

In one were older monarchies such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan; in the other were new republics with strong nationalist sentiment. The latter looked to Egyptian President Gamal Nasser and his effort to create a united Arab republic.<br />One week after the death of the king of Yemen, Ahmad bin Yahya, a military coup was carried out on 26 September 1962 against his young heir Imam Muhammad al-Badr. A republic was proclaimed, with support from Egypt, and al-Badr managed to flee from the capital city of Sanaa. Saudi Arabia supported the royalists controlling the northern part of Yemen, and a civil war ensued.<br />Although Egyptian solders were sent to Yemen to support the republic, they were not able to prevail. The royalists were supported by Saudi Arabia and secretly received arms and financial aid from the UK. The British still controlled Aden and an area along the southern coast. The international community therefore feared that the situation would turn into a more extensive conflict involving other countries.</p>"

Further, a demilitarised zone was to be set up along the Yemen-Saudi Arabia border to prevent bases in Saudi Arabia from being used to attack the republic and to prevent the entry of weapons.<br />King Hussein of Jordan in 1962 had suggested that a UN observation mission be sent to Yemen. In order to secure compliance with the agreement between Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the UN Security Council approved Resolution 179 in June 1963 and thereby provided a mandate for the Secretary-General to initiate the dispatch of an international group of observers. They were given a much more modest mandate than those of other missions in that there was no ceasefire to maintain between the various groups in Yemen. The purpose was strictly to observe and report on the withdrawal of Egyptian soldiers and to verify that Saudi Arabia maintained the demilitarised zone and ceased supporting the royalists.</p>"

The mandate did not include supervision of the borders with British colonies. The Egyptian soldiers were slow to leave and often did so only when republican forces had gained a foothold in an area.<br />During the summer of 1964, some progress was made. Shortly after the termination of <em>UNYOM </em>in September, Egypt and Saudi Arabia entered into an agreement to work together to resolve the conflict.

This agreement still stands. The ceasefire agreement is purely a military agreement and does not involve the respective nations.

The Iraqi government cracked down hard on the rebels and on the civilian population, thus displacing a great many people from their homes. As a result, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 688 to demand that Iraq permit humanitarian aid organisations to enter the country. It further condemned Iraq’s oppression of its people. The Security Council asked that all nations contribute to the emergency aid work.

Iraq used chemical weapons, and civilians were constantly bombarded by both parties. The UN, without success, attempted from the beginning to mediate between the parties. The war affected merchant ships in the Persian Gulf, causing some nations to send warships as escorts. During one of these escorts, an Iranian passenger plane with 290 people on board was shot down in error. The UN Security Council in 1987 approved Resolution 598 calling for an immediate ceasefire, initiation of a fair peace process, and deployment of peace observers. Iraq gave the resolution a positive response and indicated a desire to work with the UN to reach a peace treaty with Iran. Iran, however, was not of a mind to cooperate. Just under a year of intense diplomatic negotiations between the UN, Iran, and Iraq in July 1988 produced consent from Iran to accept the resolution, and the ceasefire thus began. On this basis, the <em>United Nations Iran-Iraq Military Observer Group</em> (<em>UNIIMOG</em>) was established.</p>\n<p> </p>"

That generated ethnic strife and demands for autonomy or for joining one of the other new states. Georgia was one of those republics. It became independent in 1991. The celebration was brief because separatist groups in the region of Abkhazia attempted to secede from Georgia.

Previously that year, the Government had, in consultation with the Danish Foreign Policy Committee, joined a ground forces contribution during the period in which Belgium (as the first nation) contributed to the enforcement of sovereignty in the Baltics.<br />Denmark made F-16 aircraft and personnel available to ensure that the Baltic states had the same sense of security as that of NATO’s other member states. Denmark had so far provided the Baltic states with considerable support in their attempts to gain membership of NATO and in building their armed forces. The Danish Government of the day therefore considered the contribution to protect Baltic air space as a natural progression. In its decision, the Danish Parliament also mandated the deployed aircraft to use force if necessary to enforce the integrity of these states. The proposal was adopted with 97 votes in favour and 1 vote opposed. 7 MPs abstained. <br /></span><span>After consultation with the Foreig Policy Committee in January 2022 it was decided to contribute with additional 4 F-16 starting in January and for three mounth. </span></p>"

Two Danish F-16s were deployed in 2009. 2011 saw the deployment of four jets and 50 ground crew and equipment to keep the jets in the air. In 2013, four aircraft and 45-50 personnel were once again deployed. 2014 saw the deployment of six F-16s and 50 personnel. In 2018, the mission ran for four months, starting in January. This time four jets and approx. 60 personnel were deployed. And that’s not the end of it. 2019 saw another deployment and there are likely to be more in future. In 2021 the deployment was from september to december. Because of the tensions in Europe between East and West additional 4 F-16 were deplyed to the Baltic states from January 2022.

                        "text": "<p><span>West Sahara is in north-western Africa, bordering with Morocco to the north, Algeria to the north east and Mauritania to the south west and has long been the subject of territorial disputes. The area was a Spanish colony for almost a century from 1884 until 1976, when Franco’s Spain would not relinquish the area despite demands from the global community to do so. When Franco died in 1975 it became possible to conduct a referendum to find out whether West Sahara’s population preferred independence or to become part of another country. Morocco had a different view and demanded the whole area, based on historical relationships. The international courts in the Hague did not recognise this demand and recommended that the referendum should proceed as planned. Morocco did not accept the court ruling and occupied the northern part of the country in 1975. Mauritania occupied the south eastern area.<br />The local population had already formed a rebel group called Frente Popular de Liberación de Saguía el Hamra y Río de Oro (POLISARIO). This group had previously fought against the Spanish for territory in the western Sahara. The group now took up arms against the Moroccan and Mauritanian occupying forces. Mauritania had to accept defeat in 1979. Mauritania then withdrew from the war and has remained neutral ever since. Moroccan armed forces continued fighting, which continued to lesser or greater degrees for over a decade. During the war Morocco built a 2,500 long line of defence that now splits the area into two. Morocco continues to occupy the western part of the area, the remaining area being controlled by POLISARIO. The Saharawis live partly in the Moroccan-controlled area and partly in large refugee camps in Algeria close to the border with West Sahara.</span></p>\n<p><span>After many years of war, the UN was finally able to persuade the two sides to agree to a ceasefire and begin preparations for a referendum about the area's future status and affiliation. 1991 saw the beginning of <em>MINURSO</em>, which had the role of monitoring the ceasefire and implementing the referendum.<br />It was expected that the mission would be completed in just a few months. Unfortunately, it would not be so simple. Because of the fluid border and the nomadic Bedouin tribes, there were political and practical challenges when it came to registering voters. The mission came close to fruition in 1999, but Morocco demanded the registration of a further 180,000 pro-Morocco people, which caused the UN to postpone the referendum indefinitely.<br />In recent years the UN Security Council has tried to bring about a peaceful politically-negotiated solution between Morocco and POLISARIO.   These negotiations have barely made any progress, which can be attributed in part to a failure to agree and a lack of support from the permanent members of the UN Security Council.</span></p>\n<p>Denmark prepared to deploy a company of troops to West Sahara as a contribution to MINURSO in 1998. The proposal for Danish support for this operation was founded in UN Security Council Resolution 1148 of 26 January 1998, which enabled an expansion of the <em>MINURSO</em> mission. The Danish Government suggested that Denmark should, as part of this expansion, contribute to the UN peacekeeping operation in West Sahara. The purpose of this aid was to ensure a safe framework for the planned referendum and to allow refugees to return. The contribution would also assist in ceasefire monitoring and the surveillance and control of troop withdrawals and the supervision of selected arms depots. The Danish Parliamentary proposal was adopted with 102 votes in favour and 11 votes against. Soon afterwards, a team from Denmark carried out a reconnaissance mission in the area to prepare the deployment and to plan how the operation would proceed. The deployment did not come to fruition, however, due to the political gridlock in the area.</p>"

The mandate was intended to take the form of UN envoys who would have full control and responsibility for all aspects of a referendum in which the people of West Sahara would vote on a choice between independence or becoming part of Morocco. The mandate would also ensure that a ceasefire was agreed between the two rivals and that the Moroccan troop presence would also be reduced.<br />Even though the mandate is yet to open a path towards a referendum, it has nevertheless enabled the agreement to and compliance with a fragile ceasefire.

This was problematic as the Kivu region was populated by ethnic Tutsis and other tribes. After their arrival, the Hutus wanted access to Zaire’s eastern natural resources and to ethnically cleanse Tutsis and topple the government of Rwanda (Rwanda's government was under Tutsi control). Because of the numerous attempts by Hutus to invade Rwanda, pro-Tutsi army commander Laurent Kabila decided to fight the Hutus in Zaire. In 1996 he received help from Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi, which is partly why the first Congo war is also known as Africa’s First World War. In 1997 Kabila and his Tutsi forces were able to gain control of Zaire's capital Kinshasha and renamed the country to the name by which it is known today (the Democratic Republic of Congo). 1998 saw the formation of rebel groups who opposed the sitting Kabila government and unrest erupted in DR Congo. Despite receiving military aid from Angola, Chad, Namibia and Zimbabwe the Kabila government lost control of large parts of the country to the rebel groups. A ceasefire was signed between the opposing sides in 1999. <em>United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC)</em> was set up in 1999 to assist in the continued process. This mission was active until 2010, when it was renamed the <em>United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</em><em>(MONUSCO</em>).

                        "text": "<p>The ”<em>Standby High-Readiness Brigade” (SHIRBRIG</em>) unit grew out of the need for the UN to have a high-readiness unit available for action in areas of conflict and disaster. In 1994, the UN decided to send 5,000 troops to Rwanda to end the genocide, but no countries were willing to contribute soldiers. Then, Denmark took the initiative, working closely with the UN, to create a high-readiness unit. Defence Minister Hans Hækkerup was a driving force. The concept had been set out in 1993 and 1995 at the UN in the report “An Agenda for Peace” (and its supplement) written by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In it, he argued for an ”instrument” for faster deployment of troops to conflict areas. The brigade was to focus on peacebuilding missions and to stand by in high readiness in case the UN had a need. Until then, the UN had set up peacekeeping forces according to a very time consuming model. There was a need to establish a brigade that could be deployed far more quickly than had been possible earlier. The basic concept was that the units of the brigade could be deployed to an area plagued by conflict, set up a UN mission, establish a headquarters, and pave the way for subsequent forces before withdrawing and leaving the specific tasks to them and to forces deployed later. The establishment of this brigade took only a few years. At the launch of this effort on 15 December 1996, the defence ministers of Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Poland, Austria, and Denmark signed a declaration of political intent with respect to the brigade. These countries declared themselves willing to collaborate on building the brigade. Later, other countries joined, among them Ireland, Argentina, Italy, Lithuania, and Spain. Other nations signed up as observers. About 25 countries all over the world were more or less directly involved in SHIRBRIG as contributors to the unit or as supporters of the concept. The SHIRBRIG Brigade was formally launched at a 1997 parade at the Royal Guard Barracks in Høvelte, Denmark. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan was in attendance. SHIRBRIG and its units were to be deployed for a maximum of six months. The Brigade had its first test in Eritrea and Ethiopia under United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE). Parts of the Brigade (staff, headquarters, and an infantry battalion) were deployed for six months. At the end of 2000, a total of 14 countries had signed one or more of the agreement documents related to the collaborative effort and thus became formal partners. The Brigade headquarters, including a planning element, was housed at the Høvelte Barracks north of Copenhagen.<br />In 2005-2009, SHIRBRIG acted as ”midwife” for similar brigades in Africa in collaboration with the African Union. Among the achievements here were two brigade structures, one in the east of Africa (EASBRIG) and one in the west of Africa (ECOBRIG).</p>"

In July 1999, the two countries accepted an agreement to withdraw troops from areas that had been occupied after 1998. There was to be an investigation into the exact placement of the border. Although this investigation was performed by neutral agents, tensions in the border area ran high, and hostilities might erupt at any time.  Many attempts were made to keep Ethiopia and Eritrea on their respective sides of the so far determined borders, but hostilities erupted again on 12 May 2000. Then, the OAU and the UN made efforts to craft solutions, and on 31 June 2000, the UN Security Council approved a resolution that would enable the deployment of up to 100 observers and provide the required assistance in and to the two countries. The conflict was resolved when on 12 December 2000 the two countries signed a peace treaty and withdrew their military forces. Since 2000, there have still been tensions between the two countries, and UN forces were still needed. The miussion UNMEE terminated in 2008 after adopting Resolution 1827.   </span></p>"

                        "text": "<p><span>India and Pakistan became independent nations in 1947. British India was divided into West Pakistan, East Pakistan, and India. The region and the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir, together more than five times the size of Denmark, now were to choose whether they wanted to join India or Pakistan. After an intervention by Indian forces, Kashmir became a part of India while Pakistan occupied the western state of Jammu. This led to extensive hostilities between the countries, and the UN intervened in an attempt to put an end to the fighting. The UN in 1948 initiated <em>United Nations Commission for India and Pakistan (UNCIP)</em> and dispatched observers to work toward reaching a ceasefire and monitor the overall situation. The outcome of discussions in the UN Security Council was a ceasefire line giving Pakistan about a third and India about two thirds of Jammu and Kashmir, the so-called Kashmir agreement.<br /></span><span>The <em>UNCIP</em> observers were dispatched in 1949. This mission was replaced in 1951 by <em>United Nations Military Observers Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP)</em>. UNMOGIP took on the role of mediator between the two countries. The conflict turned more serious in 1957 when Kashmir became a state within India as a result of changes to the Indian constitution. </span></p>\n<p><span>Not only India and Pakistan have fanned the flames. China and Pakistan in March 1963 entered into an agreement respecting their border; it granted China a sizeable portion of Pakistan-administered Kashmir to the north. Renewed fighting between India and Pakistan erupted in early 1965. A ceasefire was declared in July, orchestrated by the British. But peace was fleeting. In August, violent battles were fought until Soviet mediation put an end to them in September. There were quite a few players indeed.<br />In 1971, hostilities once again broke out. This time, the trigger was not Kashmir or Jammu but rather West Pakistan’s <em>Operation Searchlight</em>. Its objective was to battle East Pakistan, a country that wanted independence. (Today, East Pakistan is known as Bangladesh.) As India wished to divide Pakistan, it had an interest in supporting East Pakistan’s ambitions for independence. The support from India resulted in an ill-fated attack by West Pakistan on India. This attack went by the name <em>Operation Genghis Khan</em>. The war lasted two weeks. West Pakistan was forced to end the attack and accept the secession of East Pakistan as the nation of Bangladesh.<br /></span>Upon mediation by the UN, a ceasefire was struck on 17 December 1971. It later led to the agreement referred to as the Simla Agreement. This agreement confirms that any decision respecting the future of Kashmir is to be made bilaterally between the two countries and stipulates that both countries must respect the “Line of Control” (the ceasefire line).<br />However, this was not the end. Fighting took place in 1989 over a piece of no man’s land at an elevation of 5,000 metres (16,400 feet), an area not included in the “Line of Control”.</p>\n<p>Ever since then, unrest has characterised the area. There have been bombings, abductions, demonstrations, and armed clashes between militant rebel groups.<br />Fighting continued in 1999 with advances by Pakistan. The forces retreated in July, India having suffered significant losses. To this day, the relationship between the two countries has been tense and unresolved, as seen most recently in the air strikes of 2019.<br />There was and there still is a need for observers to mediate and monitor the situation and to help ensure that the two countries refrain from violating the ceasefire agreement. The UN mission <em>UNMOGIP</em> still deploys observers along the border between the two countries.</p>"

South Africa had sided with Britain during World War I and occupied the area in 1915. Per the Treaty of Versailles, South Africa now maintained control of the territory. It was to be administered on behalf of the League of Nations. The original intent was to put the territory under administration, but when the League of Nations was replaced by the United Nations after World War II, South Africa refused to prepare South West Africa for independence. The UN annulled South Africa’s mandate to administer South West Africa in 1966 and took direct control of the territory. It became the only territory ever to be controlled directly by the UN. It was decided in 1969 that it would be illegal for South Africa to carry out activities in the area or extract natural resources (as of 1974) while work was being done to establish an independent Namibian nation. It was then decided in 1976 that South Africa needed to accept preparations for a UN-supervised referendum in the area. South Africa did not; however that was no hindrance for the work done by the UN to hold a referendum including the setting up of <em>United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) </em>in 1978. By 1988, pressure from the UN made South Africa agree to work toward referenda in South West Africa. With the participation of the 49 nations involved in <em>UNTAG</em>, South West Africa gained independence on 21 March 1990 and took the name Namibia. On 23 April 1990, Namibia became the 160th member of the United Nations. </span></p>"

It took a turn for the worse in 1991 when President Siad Barre was forced to resign. Supporters of Interim President Ali Mahdi Mohamed and of General Mohamed Farah Aidid then entered into armed conflict to declare one of them the ruler of Somalia. The United Nations launched several interventions to quell the hostilities in the country. One of them was the 1993-1995 United Nations Operation in Somalia II (UNOSOM II). At the end of this operation, the UN in 1995 established the WFP Somalia Country Office in Nairobi. Its aim was to deliver humanitarian aid to the Somalian people and to other populations in the Horn of Africa that had been impacted by crop failures for many years. It was estimated that about 11 million people needed aid – especially in Ethiopia and Somalia. The UN has been providing aid, and still does so, by ensuring that food aid is delivered safely to the country by freighters. In 2008, Denmark contributed to the protection of supply ships by sending the patrol vessel Thetis. To this day, Somalia experiences famine and instability. As a result, the WFP is still operating in the area. In 2011, Denmark again took part in the work of the WFP, this time by supplying personnel from the Danish Emergency Management Agency.</p>"

The result of the referendum was a 78.5% vote in favour of independence.</p>\n<p><em>UNAMET</em> had no mandate to be responsible for security during the vote, which meant that Indonesia’s police and military were charged with the task. The stance of neither body was neutral with regard to the outcome of the vote. Violent pro-Indonesian militias had a free rein to cause havoc in East Timor, which led to large areas of the capital city being turned into ruins. Over 1,000 East Timorians were killed, and half of the country’s population had fled. Most of <em>UNAMET</em>’s personnel was evacuated from the region to Australia during the unrest.<br />The Indonesian Government was either unwilling or unable to stop the violence. After increasing pressure from the UN Security Council and the USA, Indonesia was finally persuaded to allow the deployment of an international force in East Timor.<br />Because of the slow and bureaucratic process that is involved when deploying a multi-national UN force, a solution of this type was not appropriate with regard to the emergency situation in East Timor. The UN Security Council therefore decided in September 1999 to authorise the formation of a multi-national force under a common leadership. Australia offered to lead a coalition of willing nations towards restoring law and order to East Timor. The mission, named <em>International Force for East Timor</em> (<em>INTERFET</em>), was already in East Timor just five days after the Security Council resolution was approved.</p>"

Because of the atmosphere of political tension that was a feature of the 1950s, the decision to contribute to the mission posed a dilemma. On the one hand, Denmark was unwilling to provoke the Soviet Union by contributing a military unit, while on the other, Denmark wanted to ensure continued political goodwill with it’s US ally.<br />Initially, Denmark offered to contribute medicines to Korea, followed by a proposal to contribute an ambulance unit from Danish Red Cross. The UN and USA wanted Denmark to provide a contingent of troops and considered both proposals to be insufficient. The Danish Government therefore decided on 18 August 1950 that it would make the ship <em>Jutlandia</em> available in a hospital ship role. The Americans were more satisfied with this solution, but would still rather have seen a contribution of troops from Denmark.<br />The ship was built at Nakskov Shipyard in 1934 as a cargo and passenger vessel. Nakskov Shipyard was also responsible for the conversion to a hospital ship, which required a reconfiguration of the ship to accommodate approx. 300 patients and the installation of five hospital wards and three operating theatres.<br /><em>Jutlandia </em>would eventually be able to sail for Korea on 23 January 1951.</p>"

She returned to Europe twice during the mission, performing the role of transporting patients on the return journey. Upon her return to Denmark, the crew was replaced and problems with the ship were fixed. This included the fitting of a helicopter deck when she returned to Denmark for the second time.<br />For the first two trips the ship was docked at the harbour in Pusan, far from the front line. The final trip was somewhat different, with a deployment to the Incheon bay, close to the fighting.<br /><em>Jutlandia</em>’s work was particularly notable because of its civilian and humanitarian objective. The ship’s crew would therefore admit UN and Korean troops, as well as children and other civilians for medical treatment, which was unusual for military hospital ships. The USA and UN took a reserved stance to this and did not consider it to be a wise course of action, as they wanted the hospital ship to be ready for an emergency and preferred only a few beds to be occupied at a time (so the hospital could accept military casualties for treatment).<br />Ultimately, it seemed clear that far more civilians were treated than UN soldiers. This means that in practical terms, the expedition ended up having a rather different purpose to what was envisaged in the UN and US plan. This benefited the Korean population, who would be very appreciative of <em>Jutlandia</em>.<br /><span> </span>A total of 630 Danes took part in the mission, including doctors, nurses, carers, administrative personnel and the ship’s crew. According to the ship’s own statistics, the hospital ship treated 4,981 patients. These figures only include UN soldiers, however. The commander of the expedition, Kai Hammerich, estimated that about 6,000 Koreans had been treated but actually thought that that figure should probably be tripled. <br />Because this was a civilian mission, the crew was also comprised of civilians who had been recruited on a voluntary basis and deployed under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark rather than the Danish Ministry of Defence. Expedition commander Kai Hammerich retained his ranks as a naval officer, however, so as to better be able to be part of the UN unit command for the sphere of operations.</p>"

The ceasefire agreement also contained guidelines on the return of war prisoners and the creation of a demarcation line through Korea, with a two-kilometre wide demilitarised zone on each side of the border. The two parties also agreed to find a peaceful solution at state level within three months.

As of 2012, several military clashes took place in the border regions between Turkey and Syria. These clashes culminated in October 2012 when Syrian government forces fired artillery across the Turkish border, killing 5 and injuring 10 Turkish civilians. Turkey was unable to defend itself against ballistic missiles and feared Syria’s capacity and intent to use chemical weapons. Concerned that the situation would further escalate, Turkey decided to request NATO assistance in defending Turkish air space. In December 2012, NATO granted the request by boosting Turkey’s defence capacity with Patriot surface-to-air missiles installed at the Turkish-Syrian border.

A third flew into the Pentagon, headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense. A fourth crashed in a field, in all probability while headed towards the White House. Almost 3,000 people were killed in these attacks, that shook the world out of the optimism of the 1990s after the end of the Cold War. Over the following days, it was revealed that 19 hijackers were responsible for the attacks, which had been planned by the Islamic Al-Qaeda terror network, led by Osama bin Laden.<br />The organisation had been responsible for a number of attacks over the years leading up to the one on 11 September. Targets were Muslims that they considered kafir (heretics), and foreign nations that they believed had to much influence in the Islamic world. Their first attacks included bombing US embassies in Eastern Africa and an attack on an American destroyer, the USS Cole, off the coast of Yemen.<br />Shortly after the attack on the World Trade Center, President Bush declared an international war against terror. The primary goal was to defeat Al-Qaeda and similar organisations, as well as the countries that were supporting them or allowing them to organise in their territory, as Afghanistan had been doing under the Taliban regime. A large number of initiatives were set in motion, including: increased authority for security services and wider international partnerships between the security agencies of various countries, an invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban and destroy Al-Qaeda’s training bases there and naval operations in the Mediterranean to prevent the transportation of arms to terrorists and to protect international trade. Naval operations in the Mediterranean were given the name <em>Operation Active Endeavour</em>.</p>"

The resolutions were a confirmation that the UN considered this an international attack on the US and a thread to international peace and security. Accordingly, the UN accepted the right of the US and its allies to independent and collective self defence and encouraged all UN member states to cooperate in bringing the culprits to justice and to oppose all organisations with links to international terrorism.<br />After the attacks on 11 September, NATO’s supreme authority, the North Atlantic Council, decided that it, like the UN, considered the incident to be an attack on the US and that it qualified the triggering of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, also known as the “all for one and one for all” musketeer oath. An attack on one member of NATO should be considered an attack on all NATO member states. The US NATO representative confirmed that the attack was carried out by Al-Qaeda. This was therefore an attack by an external power and the US invoked Article V. To date, this is the first and only time that this part of the treaty has been triggered.<br />Barely a month after the attack, NATO announced on 9 October that it would be deploying a naval task force in the east Mediterranean to combat international terrorism at sea. On 26 October, it was authorised by NATO’s military committee under the code name <em>Operation Active Endeavour</em>, that the Atlantic fleet’s standing naval forces, STANAVFORLANT, would alternate with STANAVFORMED, in the patrolling of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>\n<p>It was decided in 2004 that the operation would be broadened to cover the entire Mediterranean, not just waters in the East. After reorganisation, STANAVFORLANT and STANAVFORMED were renamed in 2005 to, respectively, Standing NATO Maritime Groups 1 and 2 (SNMG-1 &amp; SNMG-2). The structure of Operation Active Endeavour was reassessed and amended in January 2010. After this time, fewer ships would be operating permanently on the Mediterranean, but the two naval task forces would be able to periodically transfer a large-scale naval force to the area for shorter periods.</p>"

The basis for participation in this operation comes from Danish Parliamentary proposal B59 from 2009, which mandated the two ships to hunt pirates off the east coast of Africa as part of <em>NATO’s Operation Ocean Shield</em>. The proposal also included Danish parliamentary authorisation for the ships to be part of this naval task force and to carry out the permanent missions of SNMG-1 under NATO auspices, and for involvement on the Mediterranean as part of Active Endeavour.<br />The proposal concerning Operation Ocean Shield and piracy off the coast of Somalia was unanimously adopted with 102 votes on 17 December 2009.</p>"

With 14,000 infected and 4,000 dead in the course of two and a half years, the health system of Sierra Leone quickly collapsed.<br />In 2014, it was estimated that with every passing hour, five new infections occurred. It was clear that a coordinated international effort was needed to contain the disease – for humanitarian reasons to be sure, but also to avoid contagion across the rest of the continent.<br />In August 2014, the World Health Organization declared the Ebola epidemic a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). In September 2014, the UN Security Council declared that the outbreak was a threat to international peace and security and urged all UN members and UN operational units to take the matter seriously and contribute additional resources to fight the epidemic. As part of the effort to fight Ebola in West Africa, the UK initiated Operation GRITROCK to combat and limit the spread of Ebola in Sierra Leone.</p>"

The Resolution urged all UN nations to contribute to the eradication of Ebola in West Africa. The British Operation GRITROCK was a military and civilian effort that played a significant role in the fight against Ebola in Sierra Leone. <br />The operation was structured in three phases (phase 1: Containment and Protection; phase 2: Expansion and Influence; phase 3: Eradication of Ebola). The first phase made heavy use of military resources to create stability and order in the capital city of Freetown, construct treatment centres and train health workers, and set up an effective command structure for the fight against Ebola.<br />The second phase focused on eliminating the remaining outbreaks in the country and initiating the demilitarisation of the mission.<br />The third and final phase – with new cases occurring much less frequently – saw the mission further demilitarised. In order to deal with the last cases of Ebola contagion, the mission shifted to an intelligence based strategy for finding and isolating these last cases. <br />Operation GRITROCK began on 21 September 2014 and lasted for more than 14 months. Over 1,500 British military personnel took part. The mission concluded on 13 December 2015. </p>"

These rebel groups received significant support from Pakistan and the US. In 1988, a peace accord between Afghanistan and Pakistan involving the Soviet Union and the US was entered into. Known as the Geneva Accords, the agreement established the <em>United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan </em>(<em>UNGOMAP</em>). The primary work of this mission was to monitor the withdrawal of Soviet troops, to assist in a political solution to the problems in Afghanistan, and to deal with the return of Afghan refugees from Pakistan.<br />When the Soviet Union withdrew its military troops from Afghanistan in 1989, <em>UNGOMAP</em> had fulfilled one of those three mandates. Due to insufficient financing and lack of political will on the part of the parties to the peace accord, the mission was unable to fulfil the entirety of the mandate. The mission was terminated in 1990 for two reasons: There was a lack of political interest at the UN Security Council, and the mission was regarded as being ineffectual given the continuing civil war in Afghanistan.<br />The UN Secretary-General still wished to continue the mission based on the remainder of the mandate. The Secretary-General was able to obtain a single officer from each of 10 countries contributing to <em>UNGOMAP</em>, including Denmark. These officers were to assist the Secretary-General’s personal representative in Afghanistan; hence the mission was known as <em>Office of the Secretary-General in Afghanistan and Pakistan</em> (<em>OSGAP</em>).</p>"

Upon the fall of the Soviet Union in December 1991, this support ended, and in 1992 the government lost Kabul to the Mujahideen rebels. Immediately after the fall of Kabul, a protracted conflict ensued among the various rebel groups vying for power in Afghanistan.

After World War II, West Timor became a part of newly independent Indonesia while East Timor remained under Portuguese rule. After the Carnation Revolution in Portugal in 1974, the new government initiated a gradual decolonisation of its overseas territories. In the ensuing power vacuum in East Timor, a three-week civil war broke out in 1975 between the Timorese Democratic Union, a conservative party, and Fretilin, a leftist party.<br />The war was won by popular Fretilin. Immediately afterwards, the party declared independence for East Timor. Its marxist rhetoric caused concern on the part of East Timor’s neighbour Indonesia and Indonesia’s close ally the U.S. The prospect of a pro-Soviet regime in the heart of its national territory prompted Indonesia to invade East Timor just nine days after the declaration of independence. Indonesia occupied East Timor until 1999. During the occupation, frequent violent clashes took place between the Indonesian military and East Timorese rebel groups, especially Fretilin.<br />Indonesian soldiers in 1991 killed about 200 East Timorese activists. Documented and filmed by foreign journalists, the event gave rise to strong anti-Indonesian sentiment internationally. A major political upheaval in Indonesia in 1998 and continued pressure from the rest of the world persuaded the Indonesian government in Jakarta to agree to a referendum on independence in East Timor.<br />The UN Security Council then set up <em>United Nations Mission in East Timor</em> (<em>UNAMET</em>) to assist East Timor in holding this referendum.</p>"

A third flew into the Pentagon, headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense. A fourth crashed in a field, in all probability while headed towards the White House. Almost 3,000 people were killed in these attacks, that shook the world out of the optimism of the 1990s after the end of the Cold War. Over the following days, it was revealed that 19 hijackers were responsible for the attacks, which had been planned by the Islamic Al-Qaeda terror network, led by Osama bin Laden.<br />The organisation had been responsible for a number of attacks over the years leading up to the one on 11 September. Targets were Muslims that they considered kafir (heretics), and foreign nations that they believed had to much influence in the Islamic world. Their first attacks included bombing US embassies in Eastern Africa and an attack on an American destroyer, the USS COLE, off the coast of Yemen.<br />Shortly after the attack on the World Trade Center, President Bush declared an international war against terror. The primary goal was to defeat Al-Qaeda and similar organisations, as well as the countries that were supporting them or allowing them to organise in their territory, as Afghanistan had been doing under the Taliban regime. A large number of initiatives were set in motion, including: increased authority for security services and wider international partnerships between the security agencies of various countries, an invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban and destroy Al-Qaeda’s training bases there and naval operations in the Mediterranean to prevent the transportation of arms to terrorists and to protect international trade. Naval operations in the Mediterranean were given the name <em>Operation Active Endeavour.</em></p>"

The resolutions were a confirmation that the UN considered this an international attack on the US and a thread to international peace and security. Accordingly, the UN accepted the right of the US and its allies to independent and collective self defence and encouraged all UN member states to cooperate in bringing the culprits to justice and to oppose all organisations with links to international terrorism.<br />On 12 September, just one day after the attack, NATO’s supreme authority, the North Atlantic Council, decided that it, like the UN, considered the incident to be an attack on the US and that it qualified the triggering of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, also known as the “all for one and one for all” musketeer oath. An attack on one member of NATO should be considered an attack on all NATO member states. The US NATO representative confirmed that the attack was carried out by Al-Qaeda. This was therefore an attack by an external power and the US invoked Article V. To date, this is the first and only time that this part of the treaty has been triggered.<br />Barely a month after the attack, NATO announced on 9 October that it would be deploying a naval task force in the east Mediterranean to combat international terrorism at sea. On 26 October, it was authorised by NATO’s military committee under the code name <em>Operation Active Endeavour</em>, that the Atlantic fleet’s standing naval forces, STANAVFORLANT, would alternate with STANAVFORMED, in the patrolling of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>"

Here, STANAVFORLANT divided into groups that alternated the various missions and rest periods where they were stationed at various Mediterranean ports. <em>Niels Juel</em> was part of a group that was initially tasked with carrying out patrol missions near the mouth of the Suez Canal in the Mediterranean. The operational area of the group then changed to the seas around Rhodes, where the Aegean meets the Mediterranean. In these two areas, all ships were hailed and required to present identification and route plans. Several ships were also boarded and inspected. This was an attempt to attain an overview of traffic sailing to and from the Mediterranean and would hopefully result in the apprehension of potential terrorists or arms traffickers.</p>"

That could not be said of the situation in the border area near Indonesia.

The UN Security Council put pressure on Indonesia to work with the UN force in East Timor to contain the attacks and disarm the violent militia.<br /><em> UNTAET</em> thus was able to execute its mandate in a stable environment. A peaceful election for a legislative body to craft a constitution was held in 2001. Fretilin, the party declaring East Timor independent prior to the Indonesian invasion in 1975, won a decisive victory. The new national assembly, working closely with the <em>UNTAET </em>mission, crafted a constitution that took effect in February 2002. In the subsequent presidential election, former freedom fighter Xanana Gusmão won in a landslide. Upon his inauguration on 20 May 2002, East Timor became the first new country in the new millennium to proclaim independence. <em>UNTAET</em> had now fulfilled its mandate as a transitional governing body and therefore ended on that day.<br /><em>UNTAET</em> was replaced by <em>United Nations Mission of Support to East Timor</em> (<em>UNMISET</em>).</p>"

A third flew into the Pentagon, headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense. A fourth crashed in a field - in all probability while headed towards the White House. Almost 3,000 people were killed in these attacks, that shook the world out of the optimism of the 1990s after the end of the Cold War. Over the following days, it was revealed that 19 hijackers were responsible for the attacks, which had been planned by the Islamic Al-Qaeda terror network, led by Osama bin Laden.<br />The organisation had been responsible for a number of attacks over the years leading up to the one on 11 September. Targets were Muslims that they considered kafir (heretics), and foreign nations that they believed had to much influence in the Islamic world. Their first attacks included bombing US embassies in Eastern Africa and an attack on an American destroyer, the USS COLE, off the coast of Yemen.<br />Shortly after the attack on the World Trade Center, President Bush declared an international war against terror. The primary goal of the war was to defeat Al-Qaeda and similar organisations, as well as the countries that were supporting them or allowing them to organise in their territory, as Afghanistan had been doing under the Taliban regime. A large number of initiatives were set in motion. These included: increased authority for security services and wider international partnerships between the security agencies of various countries, an invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban and destroy Al-Qaeda’s training bases there and naval operations in the Mediterranean to prevent the transportation of arms to terrorists and to protect international trade. Naval operations in the Mediterranean were given the name <em>Operation Active Endeavour.</em></p>"

The resolutions were a confirmation that the UN considered this an international attack on the US and a thread to international peace and security. Accordingly the UN accepted the right of the US and its allies to independent and collective self defence and encouraged all UN member states to cooperate in bringing the culprits to justice and to oppose all organisations with links to international terrorism.<br />On 12 September, NATO’s supreme authority, the North Atlantic Council, decided that it, like the UN, considered the incident to be an attack on the US and that it qualified the triggering of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, also known as the “all for one and one for all” musketeer oath. An attack on one member of NATO should be considered an attack on all NATO member states. The US NATO representative confirmed that the attack was carried out by Al-Qaeda. This was therefore an attack by an external power and the US invoked Article V. To date, this is the first and only time that this part of the treaty has been triggered.<br />Barely a month after the attack, NATO announced on 9 October that it would be deploying a naval task force to the east Mediterranean to combat international terrorism at sea. On 26 October, it was authorised by NATO’s military committee under the code name <em>Operation Active Endeavour</em>, that the Atlantic fleet’s standing naval forces, STANAVFORLANT, would alternate with STANAVFORMED, in the patrolling of the eastern Mediterranean.</p>"

Because of increased interest in the ability to deploy the submarine to international operations in warmer waters than those of the North Sea, Sælen was fitted with a cooling system in 2000. The main armament of the submarine was eight torpedoes. It was not expected that the torpedoes would be launched, however. The most important hardware for this operation was the submarine's sonar and electronic equipment that had been installed that could listen for communications and ship profiles in the area. The 24-strong crew of the submarine was replaced twice during its time with Operation Active Endeavour. A small-scale logistical support element was also deployed in Aksaz to maintain contact with the Royal Danish Navy's Material Command and other logistical support services.</p>"

While the crew was preparing for the homeward voyage at the start of 2003, it received orders to sail instead to the Persian Gulf via the Suez Canal to provide a Royal Danish Navy presence in the area in preparation for the coming war against Iraq. A whole year would therefore go by after its departure before <em>Sælen</em> would return home.<br /><em>Operation Active Endeavour</em> began in 2001 and included the efforts of multiple other Danish contributions. This includes the participation in the operation over the years of patrol boats <em>Viben, Ravnen and command ships Absalon and Esbern Snare</em>.

The task force would patrol the area, monitoring and inspecting seaborne traffic. A particular requirement was to locate, stop and inspect traffic that may be related to international terrorism, such as arms trafficking.<br /><em>Sælen’</em>s primary mission in the Mediterranean involved surveillance, early warning and gathering intelligence. As a submarine, <em>Sælen</em> could move around in the eastern Mediterranean without being detected, monitoring shipping and being able to communicate intelligence to the other NATO ships that were patrolling the area. A patrol typically lasted three weeks, followed by a week in port for maintenance and to give the crew a break from the confined conditions of the submarine. Life in the difficult and confined conditions of a submarine is demanding, both physically and mentally. The patrols produced results that were considered highly satisfactory by Danish and foreign commands and by the crew itself.<br />There were some problems with the cooling system, however, which failed in November. This led to a very poor indoor climate with high air humidity and temperatures exceeding 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit). Not only was this difficult for the crew, but it also damaged the sonar on the submarine that was now 38 years old. The planned patrol was completed, however, before the submarine returned to Aksaz naval base, where it was possible to repair the air conditioning system. </p>"

A third flew into the Pentagon, headquarters of the U.S. Department of Defense. A fourth crashed in a field, in all probability while headed towards the White House. Almost 3,000 people were killed in these attacks, that shook the world out of the optimism of the 1990s after the end of the Cold War. Over the following days, it was revealed that 19 hijackers were responsible for the attacks, which had been planned by the Islamic Al-Qaeda terror network, led by Osama bin Laden. The organisation had been responsible for a number of attacks over the years leading up to the one on 11 September. Targets were Muslims that they considered kafir (heretics), and foreign nations that they believed had to much influence in the Islamic world. Their first attacks included bombing US embassies in Eastern Africa and an attack on an American destroyer, the USS COLE, off the coast of Yemen.<br />Shortly after the attack on the World Trade Center, President Bush declared an international war against terror. The primary goal of the war was to defeat Al-Qaeda and similar organisations, as well as the countries that were supporting them or allowing them to organise in their territory, as Afghanistan had been doing under the Taliban regime. A large number of initiatives were set in motion, including: increased authority for security services and wider international partnerships between the security agencies of various countries, an invasion of Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban and destroy Al-Qaeda’s training bases there and naval operations on the Mediterranean to prevent the transportation of arms to terrorists and to protect international trade. Naval operations in the Atlantic were given the name <em>Operation Active Endeavour (OAE)</em>.</p>"

The resolutions were a confirmation that the UN considered this an international attack on the US and a thread to international peace and security. Accordingly the UN accepted the right of the US and its allies to independent and collective self defence and encouraged all UN member states to cooperate in bringing the culprits to justice and to oppose all organisations with links to international terrorism.<br />On 12 September, NATO’s supreme authority, the North Atlantic Council, decided that it, like the UN, considered the incident to be an international attack on the US and that it qualified the triggering of Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, also known as the “all for one and one for all” musketeer oath. An attack on one member of NATO should be considered an attack on all NATO member states. The US NATO representative confirmed that the attack was carried out by Al-Qaeda. This was therefore an attack by an external power and the US invoked Article V. To date, this is the first and only time that this part of the treaty has been triggered.<br />Barely a month after the attack, NATO announced on 9 October that it would be deploying a naval task force in the east Mediterranean to combat international terrorism at sea. On 26 October, it was authorised by NATO’s military committee under the code name <em>Operation Active Endeavour</em>, that the Atlantic fleet’s standing naval forces, STANAVFORLANT, would alternate with STANAVFORMED, in the patrolling of the eastern Mediterranean.<br />It was decided at a NATO summit on 3 March 2003 that Operation Active Endeavour would be expanded to also include the Straits of Gibraltar. <em>Task Force Straits of Gibraltar (STROG)</em> would be set up to control the area and escort civilian shipping through the straits. These straits are very important to world trade and require ships to sail close to land. Because of this, an attack similar to the one on USS Cole a few years previously was feared.</p>"

The proposal was adopted by Parliament two days later, with 101 votes in favour and 5 votes opposed.<br />After consultation with the Foreign Policy Committee, the Government decided on 4 March 2003 to deploy the corvette <em>Olfert Fischer</em> to the activities of <em>Operation Active Endeavour</em>s near Gibraltar. Before its arrival, it was decided that the corvette would instead be sent to the Persian Gulf, where it would take part in the impending war against Iraq.

Escort duties were performed as part of the multinational naval force, the Danish vessels carrying out their missions in collaboration with Norwegian and Spanish vessels.<br />NATO deemed that there was little threat on the open sea, but that ports and nearby waters were at greater threat from terrorism. The Straits of Gibraltar were deemed to be a choke point and were therefore given a higher threat rating than the open sea. The main threat was believed to be from smaller vessels or aircraft that might be loaded with explosives for rapid attack. Because this is an area of heavy sea traffic, there were many fishing and pleasure vessels which often sailed too close and had to be ordered away. It was therefore difficult to assess whether an approaching small craft was a potential hostile. All missions were therefore performed at full combat readiness, with weapons systems armed and crewed. No attacks were made on the patrol boats during the escort missions, however.</p>"

He had a long track record of being an adversary of the West as he supported Palestinian resistance groups and is believed to have masterminded several terrorist attacks against Europe and the US during the 1970s and 1980s. As part of his plans to turn Libya into a superpower, he instigated a nuclear weapons project and the production of chemical weapons. Upon the collapse of the Soviet Union, Gaddafi however did seek to normalise relations with the West. Shortly after the fall of Saddam Hussein and the uproar over weapons of mass destruction, Libya in 2004 began to decommission its chemical weapons with support from the international Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).<br />The production facilities and most of Libya’s chemical weapons had been destroyed by the time the Arab Spring began in early 2011. Unlike the developments in Tunisia and Egypt where government leaders resigned as a result of popular pressure and large demonstrations, Gaddafi remained and cracked down hard on the uprising. A civil war ensued for most of 2011. In the end, Gaddafi was ousted. The uprising received support from <em>Operation Odyssey Dawn </em>and <em>Unified Protector.</em> Danish fighter jets participated in this support.<br />Right after the fall of Gaddafi, Libya appeared relatively stable, with peaceful democratic elections for a congressional assembly to be set up in 2012 to craft a constitution and install a government. That was short lived. Subsequent to a 2014 election, many members of the previous congressional assembly refused to resign, and before long, Libya had two governments. Such a situation was not helped by the fact that the militias that had fought Gaddafi’s army were still armed and now declared loyalty to one or the other government unless, of course, they were loyal only to their own tribe. In this anarchy, several militias chose to proclaim themselves a part of the Islamic State and occupied several cities, Sirte and Derna among them</span></p>"

                        "text": "<p>The Syrian civil war began as a continuation of the Arab Spring early in 2011. In Egypt and Tunisia, the governments had resigned, but Bashar al-Assad decided to crack down hard on the demonstrators. A chain reaction followed. The crackdowns led to even more protests that were in turn attacked even more violently, and before long the demonstrators carried arms. Army deserters had formed the Free Syrian Army and collaborated with other groups to mount resistance against the regime. The conflict evolved into a proxy war when a few NATO countries, Saudi Arabia, and their allies provided materiel and political support to the opposition while Russia, Iran, and the Lebanese militia Hezbollah actively supported the Assad regime.<br />When Gaddafi in Libya had crushed the rebellion in his country, a UN mandate was obtained, and a coalition was formed to protect civilians as a matter of priority. Over time, however, this developed into an air campaign in support of rebels agitating for democracy in the struggle against him. As the Syrian civil war spread and became more violent, there were frequent reports, some of them from the UN mission in the country, of attacks on civilians. There was widespread support for the notion that the international community ought to intervene militarily to protect civilians, put an end to the civil war, and possibly oust Assad and arraign him in a war crimes court. An international crisis was on the horizon when the West supported the rebellion while Russia supported the regime. Mostly as a result of Russia’s interests in Syria and its veto power in the UN Security Council, an international mandate for an intervention could not be obtained as it had been in the case of Libya. In light of experience from the long war in the neighbouring country Iraq and out of fear of an escalating conflict with Russia, there was no appetite in the US for intervening without a clear mandate. Nevertheless, President Barack Obama said in 2012 that extensive use of chemical weapons would change his mind about an intervention.<br />Reports came out several times that Obama’s “red line” on the use of chemical weapons had been crossed, and a year after it had been drawn, all doubt was gone. In the morning of 21 August 2013, rebel-controlled areas in Ghouta, a suburb of Damascus, were hit by rockets carrying the lethal nerve agent sarin. This was the most outrageous chemical weapons attack since the war between Iran and Iraq in the 1980s. In the following days, pictures of the several hundred victims went round the world. Reports from Doctors Without Borders and UN agencies confirmed that sarin was used – at a scale and with a method only the Syrian regime could muster. Assad and his Russian supporters doggedly insisted that the rebel groups themselves were responsible for the attack.</p>\n<p>In early September, it thus looked plausible that an intervention would be made in Syria. While the West deliberated on who would take part and whether the scale of the intervention would be a massive one or a smaller one – in such a case just to make a statement that the use of chemical weapons is absolutely unacceptable – Obama requested approval from Congress to carry out an attack on Syria. The request was debated but never came to a vote because events got in the way. A journalist at a press conference asked U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry whether Assad in any way could avoid an American attack. He responded casually, seemingly half in jest, that the Syrian regime certainly might surrender all its chemical weapons for destruction by the international community, but that such a thing would of course never happen.<br />Many were surprised when Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov only hours later took Kerry at his word and proposed that Syria surrender all chemical weapons to an international group that would then destroy them. The Syrian government immediately accepted the proposal, and negotiations began as to how the surrender would proceed.</p>"

Shortly thereafter, on 27 September, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2118. It stipulated how the surrender was to proceed and provided a mandate for the UN and OPCW to inspect and destroy Syrian facilities and monitor the transport of chemical materials and for UN countries to jointly set up a mission to move them out of the country and destroy them. The biggest bone of contention in the UN Security Council negotiations had to do with consequences for Syria in the event it did not comply with the framework for the surrender of chemical weapons. The NATO countries in the UN Security Council pushed for an explicit statement that a direct military intervention would ensue from non-compliance, but Russia and China argued that a separate resolution could be passed later if it turned out that the agreement was being violated. The wording of the final agreement was vague, allowing for both interpretations.<br />In October, the Syrian government provided to OPCW a list of all its facilities for manufacturing and storing chemical weapons. UN and OPCW inspectors now began the process of identification and destruction of production facilities. The determination of the placement of the chemical weapons and creating an inventory with a view to transport and destruction was carried out. Simultaneously, work was being done to set up an international mission to remove, receive, and destroy the chemical weapons and such chemical materials as could easily be converted to use in weapons.</p>"

It was feared that twenty or so Danish soldiers armed only with their service pistols would find themselves in an extremely dangerous situation in the midst of the civil war, their security depending on the Assad regime officially considered illegitimate by Denmark. This party made it clear that had the proposal been in two parts (it did not get divided that way), it would have been willing to vote for the maritime portion of the operation so long as Danish soldiers were not sent into Syria.<br />The proposal was approved on 19 December 2013. It received 97 votes in favour and 14 votes opposed. With this decision, Denmark became the lead nation in the operation to remove chemical weapons from Syria.</p>"

Initially, the Navy sent the Danish command and support ship <em>Esbern Snare</em>. It provided escort and was the flagship from which the operation was managed. It then added the civilian ship <em>Ark Futura</em>, a roll-on roll-off transport ship. While it is civilian, it is chartered by Denmark to serve in military transport projects, primarily for NATO forces. Together with a Norwegian ship, it was to manage the transport of the chemical agents from Syria. A security team of 20 was assigned to the UN-OPCW inspectors working in Syria, and a C-130J Hercules transport plane was provided for any transportation of the inspectors. An army team of CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear) experts, Frogman Corps personnel, and two experts from the chemicals unit of the Danish Emergency Management Agency joined the mission. In addition, a mobile container scanner and associated specially trained operators were supplied by SKAT, the Danish Tax Authorities. This enabled investigation of the contents of surrendered containers without having to open them and risk exposure to the chemicals. All three of the armed forces, the Emergency Management Agency, and the Tax Authorities were represented in <em>RECSYR</em>, likely making it the most comprehensive dispatch of Danes in an international mission.<br />The commander of the Navy’s Danish Task Group had tactical leadership of <em>RECSYR</em> while the commander of the Admiral Danish Fleet had responsibility for the entire scope of the mission. This was the first time Denmark headed up an international operation of this scale. On 17 May 2014, the frigate <em>Peter Willemoes</em> took over the work of <em>Esbern Snare</em> when the command ship was transferred to the Standing NATO Maritime Group (SNMG-1) to participate in the Active Endeavour and Ocean Shield operations.<br />The total naval force in <em>RECSYR</em> was highly international with British, Chinese, Russian, and on occasion Syrian ships participating in the mission. An American ship with specialised equipment took delivery of the chemical weapons and destroyed them, some of the work being done in the UK and in Finland.</p>"

The identification of the chemical weapons was performed by the UN and OPCW teams in Syria. The Syrian army handled transportation within Syria and preparations for shipping. The <em>RECSYR</em> mission was to receive the containers in the port of Latakia, verify their contents, and ship them to locations where they could be safely destroyed.<br />The Danish ships proceeded to Latakia from a base in Limassol on Cyprus to take the cargo on board. Here, the containers were examined by the container scanners of the Tax Authorities, Emergency Management, and the chemicals experts from the army before they were loaded on board the transport ships that were to deliver, under escort, the containers for destruction. The process of destruction varied in terms of place and method according to the type of chemicals. Many of the weapons were taken to Gioia Tauro, a port city in southern Italy, where the toxic chemicals were transferred to the American container ship MV Cape Ray. It carries equipment for hydrolytic breakdown of certain chemicals in the weapons. (Destruction was performed in international waters.) Chemicals that are more difficult to degrade were shipped to facilities in the UK and in Finland that had the expertise and facilities to carry out the task.<br />The first collection from Latakia took place on 7 January 2014. A total of 19 collections were performed, the final one on 23 June 2014. In all, 181 containers were collected by the two transport ships. The Norwegian ship <em>Taiko </em>collected mostly the ”less toxic” industrial chemicals that could be converted to use in chemical weapons while the Danish ship <em>Ark Futura </em>collected the chemical weapons and the five most toxic chemicals.<br />In spite of the difficulties encountered by the inspectors in Syria and the disruptions to the timetable for transporting chemicals to Latakia, the overall operation timeline was met. Much praise was given to the Danish contribution, and the collaboration with other participating nations was smooth. Later, Denmark took charge of a similar operation, <em>RECLIB</em>, whose task was to remove chemical weapons from Libya in 2016.<br />It has since come to light that not all chemical weapons were removed from Syria. There was swift criticism that the international agreement did not include chlorine. In addition to its industrial uses, it can be converted to chlorine gas. The civil war in Syria continued to flare unabated, with devastating human suffering in its wake. On 4 April 2017, the rebel-controlled town of Khan Shaykhoun was attacked by the Syrian air force. Chemical gases appearing to be sarin were used just as in the attack on Ghouta in 2013.</p>"

                        "text": "<p><span>When the state of Israel was founded in 1948, it was immediately attacked by neighbouring Arab countries. When that war ended, Israel continued to be surrounded by hostile nations. The largest among them was Egypt. At the end of the war, it controlled Gaza City and a strip of land along the coast. The first UN observation mission, <em>UNTSO</em>, was initiated during the war. It took part in negotiating the ceasefire agreements between Israel and its neighbours. In spite of diligent efforts on the part of <em>UNTSO</em>, relations were tense, and ceasefire violations occurred frequently. Palestinian groups, especially, crossed the border from the neighbouring countries to carry out attacks inside Israel, often with the tacit consent of the Arab governments.</span></p>\n<p><span>Losing the war to Israel was a blow to many in the Arab world, one that had repercussions especially in Egypt. Britain had been a colonial ruler in Egypt since 1882, and although the Egyptian king had been officially in charge of an independent nation since 1922, he served at its pleasure with limitations on his ability to act, in particular with respect to foreign policy, and with British troops stationed in Egypt. The British had military control of the area around the Suez Canal. This canal was crucial for the Empire as it provided the shortest possible route to the colonies in Asia.  After several years of protests against the king and the British, a group of officers carried out a coup in 1952 with popular support. The group forced the king into exile and turned Egypt into a republic.  The new government prioritised as one of its early objectives the disengagement from British influence. An agreement was reached whereby the British would leave Egypt after another two years of controlling the canal area.<br />Now that the British were on the way out of Egypt, two key challenges for the new regime was to modernise the country and to handle the conflict with Israel.  In the face of considerable international objection, the Egyptian government attempted to close the Suez Canal to block Israeli trade, and in 1953 it blocked the Straits of Tiran, Israel’s only access to the Red Sea. During this time, efforts were made to develop Egypt. One key project was a dam on the Nile to provide electricity for all of Egypt. The Aswan Dam needed expertise and money. Funding was sought from the U.S. in the form of a sizeable loan. Though the Americans were willing to provide this loan, they were not willing to sell arms to the Egyptian army in light of the continued conflict with Israel. When President Nasser then made the arms purchase through communist Czechoslovakia, the U.S. refused the loan. To raise funding, the Egyptian leaders now nationalised the Suez Canal. In 1956, it was still the property of European investors.</span></p>\n<p><span>This met with disapproval in London and Paris. At a meeting in the town of Sèvres in France, the two old superpowers entered into a secret agreement with Tel Aviv. Prompted by the closure of the Straits of Tiran and the Suez Canal, Israel would attack Egypt on the Sinai Peninsula and advance toward the canal. This did occur on 29 October while Britain and France that very day issued an ultimatum for both parties to withdraw from the canal area so that it could be secured by a joint British and French force. Israel, still quite a distance from the canal, accepted the ultimatum as planned, but Egypt – having only recently gained control over the canal from Britain – refused.  On 31 October, the two European powers attacked Port Said at the Mediterranean mouth of the Suez Canal and occupied the area.</span></p>"

That request was not met, and the matter came before the UN Security Council the same day. The U.S. and the Soviet Union both supported a resolution to have Israel withdraw per the <em>UNTSO</em> request. However, Britain and France vetoed the resolution, and no progress was made. At the instigation of Yugoslavia, the matter was transferred to an emergency special session of the UN General Assembly.<br />This was the first time such an emergency session of the General Assembly had been called. The Assembly met on 1 November and until 10 November approved a number of resolutions. The first one, Resolution 997, required Egypt, Israel, Britain, and France to cease all hostilities and withdraw troops from Egyptian territory. It further stipulated that vessels from all countries be permitted to sail in the Suez Canal and the Red Sea. On a request from Canada, Resolution 998 was approved. It charged Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld with preparing a plan for a UN security force to be set up and deployed for the purpose of separating the warring parties. When the plan was submitted to the Assembly, Resolutions 1000 and 1001 were approved. They authorised the chief of <em>UNTSO </em>to recruit personnel from UN member countries. In addition, the UN set up a committee to oversee and plan the work of the force. Given that four out of five members of the Security Council were either directly involved in or closely allied with one of the parties to the conflict, it was decided that the force would be made up of personnel from member countries that did not have a seat in the Security Council and had not actively taken a side in the conflict.</p>\n<p>This is how <em>UN Emergency Force UNEF</em>, the first peacekeeping force set up by the UN, came into the world. It was directed by the then commander of <em>UNTSO</em>, the first observation mission operated by the UN. The mandate for the force was however quite narrow in comparison with later UN missions. According to the mandate, permission must be obtained from the country in which the force operated. Such permission was given only by Egypt. The force could not be armed with heavy weapons and could engage in active fighting only in self defence (and to a limited extent at that).</p>"

The mission carried on for 10 years until a new conflict began brewing in May 1967 between Israel and the neighbouring Arab countries.

The mandate from the UN General Assembly specified that the mission could operate only in areas where it had government permission to do so. Therefore, it was necessary to leave the positions in Egypt and Gaza. The Israeli government had never wanted the peacekeeping force to enter Israel, and <em>UNEF</em> was then declared at an end. The soldiers returned home.<br />Later, after another war between Israel and Egypt in October 1973, a second peacekeeping mission was set up in largely the same area and with the same guidelines. It was named <em>UNEF II</em>, and from this time onward, the earlier peacekeeping mission prior to 1967 was referred to as <em>UNEF I</em>. <em>UNEF II</em> was active until the summer of 1979 when Egypt’s President Anwar Sadat and Israel’s Prime Minister Menachem Begin entered into a lasting peace agreement that took the place of the ceasefire maintained by <em>UNEF II</em>. </span></p>\n<p><span>Denmark did not contribute to <em>UNEF II</em>.

The UN soldiers were to ensure, as much as possible, that hostile groups did not encounter each other but rather met only soldiers wearing the blue UN helmets. In the beginning, the main task was to handle the transfer of the areas along the Suez Canal from French and British troops to the Egyptian army. Then, it was Israel’s turn to be escorted out of the Sinai Peninsula. Thereafter, the job was to take over Gaza from Israel. As of spring 1957 when the last areas had been transferred, <em>UNEF</em> now went about monitoring and patrolling the long desert border between Egypt and Israel to prevent the two nations from engaging in conflict. As Israel was still not permitting <em>UNEF</em> to operate there, all the work took place on the Egyptian side of the border.</span></p>\n<p><span>The first Danish soldiers arrived in Egypt on 15 November. During November 1956, the Danish force was deployed in British-occupied Port Said, a city situated where the Suez Canal meets the Mediterranean. The assignment was to move into the areas left behind by the British so that there would be no need for a direct transfer to the Egyptians. The situation in the city was tense, and British soldiers were frequently attacked by residents. But as soon as the British had left the area and <em>UNEF</em> had moved in, the situation improved.<br />Next, traversing the Mitla Pass and the Sinai desert while escorting the Israelis out, the Danes reached Gaza in March 1957. In the course of one week, 7 to 14 March, DANOR occupied Gaza City. Danish lieutenant colonel Carl Engholm held the position of military governor until an Egyptian governor arrived to assume command. A permanent base was now set up for DANOR east of the city on historic Hill 88 in a camp built by the British when they besieged Ottoman forces in Gaza during World War I. This base became the home of DANOR for the next 10 years. That is why <em>UNEF I</em>is referred to in Denmark as the Gaza force. Then, the mission was to perform surveillance at the Israeli border and patrol the area.  The Danish soldiers were active especially in Gaza City and the areas to the north and east until the mission was terminated during the runup to a new conflict in 1967.</span></p>"

After the resignations of the presidents in Tunisia and Egypt, many held the optimistic view that this wave of democratisation would spread to the entire region. At first, though, it did not appear to be reaching Syria. The Syrian regime under Bashar al-Assad was known for being one of the most brutal in the region. When bloggers called for demonstrations in Damascus in February, just as there had been demonstrations in Egypt, more security forces than demonstrators showed up.<br />Things got more serious in March 2011. In Daraa, a town in the south of Syria, some boys were arrested for having painted graffiti. Demonstrations quickly ensued. The army was called in. This violent crackdown led to further demonstrations demanding the ouster of the regime, and these were again attacked by the army. Protests spread throughout the country. During the spring and summer, the demonstrators took up arms and started firing back at the army. Army deserters joined the demonstrators.</span></p>\n<p><span>During the summer of 2011, a government in exile was set up in neighbouring Turkey, and attempts were made to unify the various armed resistance groups in the Free Syrian Army. President Bashar al-Assad still claimed that his opponents were just Islamist terrorists and kept cracking down hard on any opposition. As the uprising grew, a civil war developed between the regime and the more or less unified rebel groups. Given that a similar recent situation had played out in Libya where a liberated city was besieged by the regime, the UN Security Council decided to provide a mandate for the international community to support the rebellion with air power. However, President Putin used Russia’s veto power in the UN Security Council to block an intervention in Syria. Russia had long been allied with the Assad regime and depended on a naval base in Syria for its activities in the Middle East.</span></p>\n<p><span>By spring 2012, a year after the start of the conflict, things kept escalating. Tens of thousands had died in the violent battles in old cities such as Damascus and Aleppo and in smaller towns. There were reports of attacks on civilians; each side in the conflict blamed them on the other side. The number of civil war refugees in the neighbouring countries was nearing half a million, and the number grew at an alarming rate with internally displaced people trying to get away from areas of heavy fighting.  </span></p>"

In early April 2012, he believed there was consent from the Syrian regime and its opponents to enter into a ceasefire and attempt to implement a six-point peace plan he was recommending. With that, the UN Security Council approved Resolution 2043 on 21 April. It called for peace and compliance with Kofi Annan’s six-point peace plan, and in addition it provided a mandate for the establishment of an observation mission named <em>United Nations Supervision Mission In Syria</em> (<em>UNSMIS</em>). The purpose here was not to intervene directly to end the conflict but rather to send 300 unarmed officers from UN member countries to watch compliance with the ceasefire and determine who was responsible for breaches. The original mandate covered 90 days with the option for an extension. It was the intent that government forces, the Free Syrian Army, and other armed groups would recognise the mission and thus guarantee the safety of the observers and their freedom of movement.</span></p>\n<p><span>On 20 July, it was decided, in Resolution 2059, to extend the mandate for another 30 days and to restructure the mission.

Some of the observers were transferred from <em>UNTSO</em>, a mission that had already been present in the region since the first Arab-Israeli war in 1948.

During a period of political transformation with shifts back and forth in the following years, unemployment rates began to increase in Albania. Simultaneously, Albania’s Greek minority population found itself in conflict with ethnic Albanians. The Albanian economy collapsed in 1996-97, including when popular “Ponzi schemes” were no longer able to pay out dividends. Many people lost millions. In 1997, there was a state of unrest in the country. The Albanian government lost control and its mandate disappeared. Albania was in a state of anarchy. The authorities no longer controlled Albanian military arms depots and these were looted by various factions. Albania was now in a state of national emergency and, in response, OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, then under Danish chairmanship) set up <em>Operation Alba</em> in accordance with a UN mandate in 1997. The process of re-establishing order and bringing about a return to stability could now commence.

Before 11 September, CTF-150 was part of the United States Naval Forces Central Command, which was tasked with patrolling the Red Sea, the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.  In 2002, command of CTF-150 was transferred from the United States Naval Forces Central Command to Germany. The task of CTF-150 changed from patrolling the Red Sea, the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea to preventing seaborne terrorism by inspecting, stopping and checking suspicious vessels. This new mission would be performed at the Horn of Africa as a result of an increase in piracy in the area. Additional to preventing piracy and terrorism, CTF-150 was given the task of supporting the ability of the regional coastal states to maintain their own maritime security in the area.  A Danish contribution in 2008 which involved the command/support ship <em>Absalon</em> and the Royal Danish Navy’s Tactical Staff was incorporated into CTF-150. The Danish Staff was also assigned command of the combined force at this time. Command of CTF-150 alternates between the participating countries approximately every 4 -6 months. Countries which have led CTF-150 include Spain, the United Kingdom, France and Pakistan. </span></p>"

CMF has been in action off the Horn of Africa, where Denmark has contributed on multiple occasions to dealing with piracy in the Gulf of Aden. CTF-151’s background came from the civil war in Somalia in the year 2000, which made it possible for foreign boats to exploit fisheries resources in the Gulf of Aden with no serious consequences. This led to locals deciding that it was a risk-free enterprise to sail out and abduct foreign fishermen and then demand the payment of a ransom. CTF-151 was set up in January 2009 to combat this problem, with a mandate that was specifically focused on a general prevention of piracy in the Gulf of Aden.  </span></p>"

The decision to assume command of CTF-151 in 2012 and the 2013 decision to deploy Danish naval vessels to the Gulf of Aden in 2014 were both based on the Danish Government’s anti-piracy strategy. Denmark's areas of focus were defined in a document titled “Strategy for the Danish counter-piracy effort 2011-2014”:</span></p>\n<p><span>- combating pirates through periodic deployment of a naval contribution and a maritime patrol aircraft,<br />- identifying practical solutions to the legal challenges posed by counterpiracy efforts,<br />- promoting international coordination and focus on counter-piracy efforts, as well as strengthening regional and bilateral cooperation on counter-piracy efforts,<br />- building capacities in order to enable the countries in the region to take on the challenges by themselves in the longer term, including support for the creation of coastguard functions in the region, as well as prison capacity in Somaliland and Puntland,<br />- enhancing the international effort to target those backing the pirates, including initiatives to counter money laundering.</span></p>\n<p><span>These points of focus were necessary because of the increased global threat from piracy and armed robbery at sea. As a seafaring nation, Denmark felt that it had a particular responsibility.  The overall purpose of this strategy was to contribute towards increased safety for international shipping in waters where global trade had significant maritime interests. Since 2008, Denmark had also been a member of an international contact group that had been set up by the UN. This group was comprised of a smaller group of countries that were being impacted and had the purpose of coordinating counterpiracy initiatives off the coast of Somalia.  In this context, Denmark assumed the chairmanship of a working group that dealt with legal issues, with particular focus on clarifying the legal basis for the arrest, handover and prosecution of pirates.</span></p>\n<p><span>When proposal B 104 was put forward on 23 January 2024 by the Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Danish Parliament decided to deploy a staff officer with a view to joining the offensive coalition against the Houthi movement's repeated attacks in and around the Red Sea since November 2023. The aim of the proposal is to reduce the Houthi movement's ability to threaten maritime security in the area. The proposal was approved with 90 votes in favour, 15 votes against and two votes undecided.</span></p>"

Mali has long been plagued by issues such as corruption, human rights violations, rebellions and weak government. Internal conflicts led to certain military factions working towards independence for northern Mali. One such group is the <em>N</em><em>ational Movement for the Liberation of Azawad</em>(MNLA). This group believed that Azawad in the northern region of Mali should be independent and conducted several attacks in the region, assisted by Al-Qaeda and others. These attacks drove Mali’s military out of Azawad and MNLA took control of the region and unofficially declared independence. Elements of Mali’s army were dissatisfied that Mali’s government had been unable to control unrest in Azawad and therefore carried out a coup d’état against Mali’s government. Unrest led to MNLA being able to gain full control of Azawad quicker than would otherwise have been the case. In 2013 the MNLA then tried to gain more territory in addition to Azawad, and the UN’s special representative to West Africa asked the UN to support Mali’s government authorities in the prevention of a humanitarian catastrophe in the country. The rebel groups were defeated in 2013 with assistance from the UN, the French army, Mali’s army and <em>the African-led International Support Mission to Mali (AFISMA)</em>. Although control had been regained over large areas of Mali, terror actions continued, and the country was badly affected by unrest.  It was necessary for the UN to maintain a presence in Mali and the global community launched a peacekeeping operation in Mali in 2013, with a view to stamping out unrest in the country and helping Mali’s authorities to re-establish the country. </span></p>\n<p>Mali is just one country where the international community wants to see stability.

The region is broadly considered an area immediately adjacent to southern Europe. The security situation in the Sahel region is characterised by violent conflicts and the widespread presence of militant Islamist groups. </p>"

People living in the Horn of Africa had taken to using piracy as a source of income, and for some years the extent of the problem had steadily become more serious. As a result, merchant ships and ships carrying humanitarian supplies were hijacked, and their crew members were taken hostage. In 2008, the EU therefore sent a request to NATO for assistance in fighting piracy. NATO approved this request and became active in the area as of 2009. In <em>OOS</em>, Denmark has participated by providing the command and support ships <em>Absalon and Esbern Snare</em>, the frigate <em>Iver Huitfeldt</em>, helicopters, and surveillance aircraft. <em>OOS </em>is regarded as a success because the number of pirates near the Horn of Africa has dropped significantly since the inception of the operation in 2009. Denmark took part in the operation along with 12 other NATO countries and 17 countries that are not members of NATO.</span></p>"

Several times, they managed to foil hijackings, seize weapons, capture pirates, and burn pirate ships. In addition, the Danish ships were to transport pirates to countries and states in Africa so that they could stand trial. This has been a legal challenge in that it was not possible to send Somali pirates back to Somalia. The reason is that the legal system in Somalia is dominated by Sharia law in contravention of the laws of Denmark and of international conventions on human rights. Therefore, Denmark needed to find a different solution as the pirates could not remain, for example, on the support ship <em>Absalon</em>. Nor was it desired that the pirates be sent to Denmark to stand trial. Agreements were therefore set up with Kenya, Tanzania, and the Seychelles. These agreements were intended to ensure that pirates captured by the Danes could stand trial without being executed or having body parts cut off as punishment for their misdeeds.<br />The Air Force was tasked with periodic surveillance of the operational area using Challenger aircraft. In so doing it has had a hand in getting an overview of the situation and setting targets for and identifying pirate activity for the vessels in the area. The Lynx helicopters on the ships have been extremely helpful as they enabled quick deployment and thus made it possible to avert hijacking attempts.   </span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>"

In 1955 – the year Sudan transitioned from being a British colony to being an independent nation – a rebellion arose in the southern part as there were fears of Arab-Muslim dominance from the northern part. The military took charge in 1958, but the unrest continued through the years, with various rulers and several instances of ethnic cleansing, until 1972. Trouble was brewing again in 1983 when the Second Sudanese Civil War erupted. The Sudanese government in the north (the Islamic and Arabic speaking part of Sudan) was opposed to independence for the south. The Second Sudanese Civil War was a continuation of the debate about independence for southern Sudan. The <em>Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement</em> (SPLA/M) fought for autonomy in the south where most of the clashes occurred. The second civil war raged from 1983 to 2005 and is regarded as being one of the longest and bloodiest civil wars in the 20th century. This time period was one plagued by fundamentalist movements, violations of human rights, states of emergency, and the like. About 1,9 million civilians died, and more than 4 million became refugees. </span>The civil war came to an end primarily thanks to a massive effort by the UN. In 2004, the UN set up a mandate to establish the preliminary operation <em>UNAMIS</em>. When <em>UNAMIS</em> ended, it was to be replaced by the <span><em>United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS</em>). </span><span>The purpose with <em>UNAMIS</em> was to arrange contact between the warring parties and plan future operations. In addition, work was needed to prepare civilians for what was to come in terms of UN activity. This work, undertaken by the Sudan government, SPLA/M, the UN, and the African Union, enabled the warring parties to sign a protocol and peace accord on 9 January 2005 in neutral territory (the cities of Machakos and Naivasha in Kenya). Subsequent to the signing, however, the civil war continued in Darfur (a region in Sudan). Overall, the shared intent was to attempt a peaceful resolution with assistance from the UN and the African Union. </span></p>"

The matter reared its head again in 1983, the year in which the Second Sudanese Civil War erupted. The Sudanese government in the north (the Islamic and Arabic speaking part of Sudan) was opposed to independence for the south. This was also behind the First Sudanese Civil war starting in 1955, the year Sudan transitioned from being a British colony to being an independent nation. This civil war lasted until 1975. The Second Sudanese Civil War was a continuation of the debate about independence for southern Sudan. The Sudan People's Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/M) fought for autonomy in the south where most of the clashes occurred. The second civil war raged from 1983 to 2005 and is considered one of the longest and bloodiest civil wars in the 20th century. About 1,9 million civilians died, and more than 4 million became refugees. Due to this situation in Sudan, the UN in 2004 set up a preliminary planning operation known as <em>UNAMIS</em>. It was intended to be replaced by the mission proper, <em>United Nations Mission in Sudan</em> (<em>UNMIS</em>). The objective of the mission was to resolve the conflict between the warring parties. This was achieved in 2011 when South Sudan became independent. Operation <em>UNMIS</em> was then terminated and was succeeded by <em>United Nations Mission in the Republic of South Sudan (UNMISS</em>). This latter mission was tasked with building peace and security in the new nation. </span></p>"

The demonstrations, referred to as Euromaidan, led to the ouster of Yanukovych and his government. With the installation of a new pro-European government and the signing of the association and free trade agreement with the EU in 2014, counter-protests arose in East Ukraine, and an illegal referendum for independence, the Crimean status referendum, was held in Crimea, a peninsula within Ukraine. Partly out of fear that Ukraine might achieve membership in the EU and subsequently membership in NATO, the Russia decided to annex Crimea. The Crimea peninsula has strategic significance for Moscow as the Russian Black Sea Fleet is based in the city of Sevastopol in the southern part of Crimea. Prior to the crisis, a treaty between Russia and Ukraine gave Russia access to this area. <br />The Crimean crisis then spread to the eastern part of Ukraine where pro-Russian separatists, supported by Russia, declared the regions of Donetsk and Lutansk independent and initiated an armed revolution against the Ukrainian army.<br />Russia engaged in a number of destabilising strategies to create social unrest among the large Russian minorities in Crimea and East Ukraine. These strategies included propaganda, information warfare, financial and material support to rebels, organisation of pro-Russian and separatist protests, and the use of force by special units not wearing insignia.<br />The activities carried out by Russia have created unrest within the large Russian minorities in parts of the post-Soviet space along with considerable worry and insecurity in several of the countries bordering on Russia. <br />Therefore, NATO in 2016 decided to initiate <em>Enhanced Forward Presence (eFP)</em> in the eastern nations of the Alliance that feel particularly vulnerable to Russian influence.</p>"

They are stationed in four NATO countries bordering on Russia: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland.<br />The primary objective of the eFP is to deter Russia from deploying regular or irregular forces in the neighbouring countries and to demonstrate solidarity in the Alliance along with the intent to adhere to Article 5 in the NATO Treaty, the so-called “Musketeer Oath” stating that an attack on one member nation is an attack on the others.</p>\n<p>The logic behind the eFP is aligned with the so-called “tripwire strategy” in which a potential attack would have Russian soldiers engaging in battle with American, British, French, German, and Danish soldiers. That would constitute a direct attack on each contributor and on the NATO Alliance as a whole. The eFP is not intended to, and is not able to, withstand a full-scale attack from Russia; its purpose is deterrence. The advantage of this strategy is that there is no need to mobilise a large military presence at the Russian border that could unnecessarily escalate the conflict through a potential arms race in Russia’s border regions.</p>"

Slobodan Milosevic came to power in Belgrade by leveraging the unrest in Kosovo and acting as a spokesman for its Serbian minority. During his term in office and while Yugoslavia was gradually falling apart, the Serbian parliament revoked Kosovo’s autonomy in 1989. During the wars in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina that ensued from the breakup of Yugoslavia, Kosovo was at first relatively peaceful. By 1997, a serious conflict erupted between the paramilitary group Kosovo Liberation Army and Serbian police officers and soldiers in the area.</span></p>\n<p><span>By February 1998, this conflict escalated and, as in other areas of Yugoslavia there were attacks on civilians along with ethnic cleansing. Both parties were responsible for attacks on civilians, but the experienced and much more skilled soldiers from Serbia cracked down hard on anything that might be interpreted as Kosovo-Albanian nationalist sentiment. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled to neighbouring countries, where NATO then deployed military forces to maintain security and provide humanitarian aid, some of it delivered by <em>Albanian Force</em> (AFOR). Although the UN Security Council urged a peaceful solution and sought to set up a mission to investigate whether ethnic cleansing was being perpetrated, diplomacy was not successful. The Yugoslav government refused to permit NATO soldiers on a peacekeeping mission as it feared that an independent Kosovo would be the result. Its stance was that the deployment of UN missions in territories such as Bosnia-Herzegovina the previous year had led to the loss of Yugoslavian territory. Belgrade did not want to see a repeat in Kosovo.</span></p>\n<p><span>After several rounds of international negotiations, particularly in Rambouillet in France, it was realised in March 1999 that the conflict could not be resolved by diplomatic means. At that time, NATO had assembled an air force for the purpose of putting pressure on the Yugoslav government, and it was deployed on missions in Kosovo and Serbia soon after the breakdown of negotiations.<br />Despite having no clear mandate from the UN, NATO decided to carry out an air campaign against what remained of Yugoslavia to stop the attacks on the Kosovo-Albanian population. Milosevic capitulated after a 78 day bombardment under <em>Operation Allied Force</em>. A so-called military-technical agreement was concluded between Belgrade and NATO on 10 June on the withdrawal of Serb forces and the insertion of an international force to Kosovo.</span></p>"

Finally, a national support group and liaison officers were assigned to the French brigade staff, in whose sector the Danish troops were operating. The Danish battalion was named DANBAT. A force from the elite Jaeger Corps was deployed shortly before the deployment to gather intelligence. The Jaeger Corps were again deployed in 2004 as reinforcements. <br /></span><span>Denmark and other contributors have since downsized their forces as the situation in Kosovo stabilised. When the mission celebrated its tenth anniversary in 2009, approximately 300 Danes were deployed as part of <em>KFOR</em>. The force currently numbers 35 soldiers deployed to guard duties and staff officers. The contribution has mainly involved personnel from the army and the Danish Home Guard, supported on various occasions by technicians from the Royal Danish Navy. A number of civilians have also occupied administrative positions. The Danish Home Guard deployed a guard platoon to Kosovo from February 2011 to June 2013. Denmark's presence in Kosovo numbers 35 soldiers and five officers from the army and the Danish Home Guard. </span></p>\n<p><span>A total of over 10,000 Danish soldiers have served with <em>KFOR</em> over the almost 20-year long mission.

This was an area where tensions were high, extending from the outskirts of the town of Mitrovica to the West to the border between Kosovo and Serbia. This was a multi-ethnic area which could quickly turn into a front line if fighting started again. It was therefore a constant task to appear to be impartial, so that neither group would feel neglected by the international <em>KFOR</em> troops. The Danish units were sent into action on multiple occasions in the Mitrovica area during confrontations between Kosovo-Albanians and Serbs, often alongside French, Belgian and Baltic units from the same sector.<br />Tensions were highest during the early period as the Danish troops arrived and shortly afterwards. Acts of retaliation were carried out in the area by the Kosovo Liberation Army and the many Kosovo-Albanian refugees during the vacuum before KFOR was able to take full control in the area,  The Kosovo Serbs did not all flee to Serbia, but gathered in the areas where they were the majority. Mitrovica was therefore split into an Albanian zone and a Serbian zone, each on its own side of the Ibar river that flows through the town. The bridges over the river often became conflict zones and had to be sealed off for periods by the troops from the international forces. </span></p>\n<p><span>The Danish contingent’s general duties were to man permanent control and observation posts, to set up mobile checkpoints, to perform escort duties and to carry out raids to find illegal arms. Another duty was the general maintenance of law and order in partnership with <em>UNMIK</em>’s police division, in which Danish police officers were also serving. Today, the task of policing has now been transferred to Kosovo’s own police force. Protecting minorities and ensuring that attacks did not take place were also an important element of these duties. For example, Danish soldiers guarded a Serbian monastery in a mainly Albanian area for a long time. In certain areas, children would be escorted to school if they had to pass through an area populated by another ethnicity.<br />For the first months, disarming the Kosovo Liberation Army was a very central task for <em>KFOR</em>. Although it was officially dissolved in the autumn of 1999, large numbers ”disappeared” at the same time and it was estimated that the Yugoslavian troops had left weapons behind for the Kosovo Serb population. Danish <em>KFOR</em> troops found large arms depots several times during the ongoing raids. As time went by the raids were stopped. Since 2002 there has been an amnesty for people who hand arms in voluntarily.  </span></p>\n<p><span>In March 2004<em> KFOR</em> had to step in during the worst unrest that had been seen in Kosovo since the conflict began in 1994. The 327 Danes who were in Kosovo at the time were still stationed close to multi-ethnic Mitrovica. On 19 March a large group of Albanian demonstrators crossed a bridge over the Ibar river, despite the intervention of French riot police who tried to stop them. The Danish troops moved in and there was street fighting between Serbs and Albanians while the multinational force tried to keep the groups apart using tear gas and shields. During the night the Danish troops experienced that their command station was being shot at and they had to return fire. At the same time, there were rumours that 1,000 armed Albanians were heading for the town. Danish Defence deployed 96 men from the army and the Jaeger Corps as reinforcements. Other NATO countries also reinforced their <em>KFOR</em> forces. After three days of rioting throughout Kosovo during which several Serb monasteries were burned to the ground the situation quietened down. Over the following days, Danish, French and Baltic troops carried out thorough searches of houses in Mitrovica to confiscate weapons and arrest the instigators of the unrest. </span></p>\n<p><span>The Danish troops lived for most of the duration of the mission at their own bases: Camp Olaf Rye &amp; Camp Holger Danske near Mitrovica. Camp Holger Danske closed down in the year 2000, the forces being congregated at a single camp. The Danish contribution was further reduced from 300 to 180 soldiers when the 21st <em>KFOR </em>team left for home in February 2010 and Camp Olaf Rye.was also shut down. The Danish forces then relocated to the nearby French camp. The present day mission of deployed Danes primarily involves guard duties in and around the hard to pronounce French <em>Camp Marechal De Lattre de Tassigny</em>, which is more often called Novo Selo after the nearest town.</span></p>\n<p><em>The police mission<br /></em><span>The overall task of the police mission was to assist Kosovo’s institutions, legal authorities, police and customs in their evolution towards being able to perform their duties for themselves, including support in the development of an independent multi-ethnic judiciary and a multi-ethnic police and customs service.<br />In partnership with the other EU aid programmes, this mission would execute its mandate in the form of mentor schemes, monitoring and advice. The mission had been given various executive duties.</span></p>\n<p><span>To achieve this, the mission would:</span></p>\n<p><span>-monitor institutions in areas related to law enforcement (including customs authorities) and ensure the creation and development of law enforcement, public order and security,<br />-help to assure that Kosovo’s law enforcement system, also including its customs authorities, was free of political interference, and to ensure that cases involving war crimes, terrorism, organised crime, corruption, crime based on ethnicity and other serious crimes were investigated correctly, that prosecutions were made and judgements passed, and that judgements were in accordance with current legislation,<br />-promote collaborative relationships and coordination between police and state prosecutor, especially with regard to organised crime, corruption, fraud and economic crime, including support for the implementation of an anti-corruption strategy and a plan for operations,<br />-to ensure that all of the mission's activities respect international standards with regard to gender equality and human rights.</span></p>\n<p><span>The mission’s headquarters were to be located in Pristina, with regional offices established throughout Kosovo and a support element in Brussels.</span></p>"

Slobodan Milošević came to power in Belgrade by taking advantage of unrest in Kosovo and by making himself the spokesman for the Serbian minority. During his time in office, the Serbian parliament revoked Kosovo’s autonomy in 1989 all the while Yugoslavia was gradually falling apart. In the beginning, during the wars in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo was relatively peaceful. By 1997, a serious conflict erupted between the paramilitary group Kosovo Liberation Army and Serbian police officers and soldiers in the area.<br />By February 1998, this conflict escalated, and as in other areas of Yugoslavia there were attacks on civilians along with acts of ethnic cleansing. Both parties were responsible for attacks on civilians, but the experienced and much more skilled soldiers from Serbia cracked down hard on anything that might be interpreted as Kosovo-Albanian nationalist sentiment. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled to neighbouring countries where NATO then deployed military forces to maintain security and provide humanitarian aid, some of it through <em>AFOR</em> (<em>Albanian Force</em>). Although the UN Security Council urged a peaceful solution and sought to set up a mission to investigate whether ethnic cleansing was being perpetrated, diplomacy was not successful. The Yugoslav government refused to permit NATO soldiers on a peacekeeping mission as it feared that an independent Kosovo would be the result. The attitude in Belgrade was that the West in Bosnia and Herzegovina had contributed to the loss of Yugoslav territory due to the deployment of UN missions. A repeat of this scenario was not desired.</span></p>\n<p><span>After several rounds of international negotiations, especially in Rambouillet in France, the hope of finding a resolution to the conflict was abandoned in March 1999. By this time, NATO had already assembled an air force for the purpose of putting pressure on the Yugoslav government. Shortly after the breakdown of negotiations, it was deployed in missions over Kosovo and Serbia.<br />In spite of the absence of a clear mandate from the UN, NATO decided, in the interest of halting the attacks on the Kosovo-Albanian population, to execute an air campaign against the rest of Yugoslavia. A bombardment lasting 78 days in <em>Operation Allied Force</em> led to a so-called military technical agreement between Milošević and NATO as to the withdrawal of Serbian troops and the transfer of control to an international force.</span></p>"

The Secretary-General was to collaborate with other international organisations in setting up a temporary administration to govern Kosovo, with extensive autonomy within Yugoslavia, until an election could be held. This administration in addition was tasked with drafting a constitution and building up the required institutions.

This objective was divided into four parts. 1) First, politically, a local democratic system was to be built to govern Kosovo. 2) Then, in collaboration with UN refugee organisation UNHCR, a huge humanitarian effort lay ahead as a result of the return of the many displaced persons from neighbouring countries. 3) In collaboration with <em>OMIK, </em>the OSCE mission, local institutions needed to be built with multi-ethnic personnel, hereunder an ombudsman, judges, and local police forces. 4) Last but not least, battle-scarred Kosovo needed rebuilding. This work was to be done in collaboration with the EU as the latter undertook fund raising and financial contributions.<br />The crafting of a legal foundation for the autonomy of Kosovo within Serbia turned out to be a major task. There was a need to craft a constitution setting out the framework for local governance in such a way that the Albanian majority and the Serbian minority were fairly represented. In this context, Kosovo was still officially an autonomous province within Serbia, and <em>UNMIK</em> has devoted a great deal of effort to addressing the relationship between the two.<br />For a long time, <em>UNMIK</em> was in charge of everything you would expect a public administration to handle. <em>UNMIK</em>undertook maintenance of roads and other infrastructure, hiring of garbage collectors, officiating at civil marriage ceremonies, and even issuing travel documents as Serbian passports were not available to the local population. Police work was undertaken jointly by <em>KFOR</em>, the police division of <em>UNMIK</em>, and <em>UNCIVPOL</em>. Danish police officers participated in the latter. </span></p>\n<p><span>The police mission had two main tasks: It was to set up a temporary force dealing with law enforcement and to participate in the rapid building of a Kosovo Police Service that was credible, professional, and independent. In so doing it had charge of law and order in Kosovo; border controls; training, guidance for, and monitoring of local police officers; and developing a command structure for the police of Kosovo. </span></p>\n<p><span>The envoy from the Danish Emergency Management Agency acted as Civil Affairs Officer in terms of building the Kosovo Protection Corps for the purpose of handling civilian matters such as establishing and managing fire fighting and emergency response and setting up a response team to deal with industrial and chemical contamination. In addition, work needed to be done with respect to setting up a search and rescue function, providing humanitarian aid to isolated areas, and offering administrative support for finding and destroying mines and other abandoned ammunition.</span></p>\n<p><span>Under the leadership of Hans Hækkerup, the first all-Kosovo election was held in 2001. The party of pacifist Ibrahim Rugova enjoyed success in this election. This party had represented the Kosovo-Albanian community during the 1990s. Many had predicted that more aggressive parties arising from the newly dissolved Kosovo Liberation Army would gain ground, and Rugova’s success was thus a positive sign. It was likewise positive that the Kosovo Serbs voted on an equal footing with the majority.<br />Final negotiations on the future status of Kosovo began in 2006, chaired by Danish diplomat Søren Jessen-Petersen. These protracted negotiations with Serbia foundered in 2007, and next year, Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia. This declaration was met with significant opposition from Serbia and Russia and led to litigation in the International Court of Justice. The Court determined that the declaration did not contravene international law. In spite of some objections, Kosovo is now recognised as an independent nation by 112 out of the 193 UN member countries. The majority among the Serbs in Kosovo, Serbia itself, Russia, and some other nations still reject the independence and still consider Kosovo to be a part of Serbia officially. In 2013, the EU succeeded in negotiating the Brussels Agreement between Kosovo and Serbia. This agreement is a step toward a normalisation of relations between the two parties; but much remains to be settled.</span></p>\n<p><span>Most of UNMIK has been terminated or significantly reduced since the declaration of independence in 2008 and the subsequent 2013 agreement. The government of Kosovo, over time, has assumed most of the administration of Kosovo. The police work performed by <em>UNCIVPOL </em>was assumed by a local force working with the EU police mission <em>EULEX</em>. EULEX is assisting Kosovo in building an independent and multi-ethnic police force.</span></p>\n<p><span> </span></p>"

By leveraging the unrest in Kosovo and acting as a spokesman for its Serbian minority, Slobodan Milosevic came to power in Belgrade. During his term in office and while Yugoslavia was gradually falling apart, the Serbian parliament revoked Kosovo’s autonomy in 1989. During the wars in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina that ensued from the breakup of Yugoslavia, Kosovo was at first relatively peaceful. By 1996, a serious conflict erupted between the paramilitary group Kosovo Liberation Army and Serbian police officers and soldiers in the area.<br />By February 1998, this conflict escalated, and as in other areas of Yugoslavia there were attacks on civilians along with ethnic cleansing. Both parties were responsible for attacks on civilians, but the experienced and much more skilled soldiers from Serbia cracked down hard on anything that might be interpreted as Kosovo-Albanian nationalist sentiment. Hundreds of thousands of refugees fled to neighbouring countries where NATO then deployed military forces to maintain security and provide humanitarian aid, some of it delivered by <em>AFOR</em> (Albanian Force). Although the UN Security Council urged a peaceful solution and sought to set up a mission to investigate whether ethnic cleansing was being perpetrated, diplomacy was not successful. The Yugoslav government refused to permit NATO soldiers on a peacekeeping mission as it feared that an independent Kosovo would be the result. The attitude on the part of the Serbs was coloured by their experiences in Bosnia-Herzegovina, among other places, where, in their opinion, they had lost Yugoslav territory due to the deployment of UN missions.</span></p>"

It was demanded that both parties permit international observers and guarantee their freedom of movement. Although Milosevic resisted any peacekeeping mission by NATO soldiers, he permitted the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) to set up an observation mission in October that year by the name <em>Kosovo Verification Mission (KVM)</em>. It was later approved by the UN Security Council in Resolution 1203 (1998).<br />When the NATO air campaign <em>Operation Allied Force</em> concluded, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1244 (1999). It became the foundation for several missions in Kosovo. <em>KFOR</em> (Kosovo Force) was meant to ensure peace and military control of Kosovo, and <em>UNMIK</em> (United Nations Mission in Kosovo) was set up as a temporary international administrative entity in the area. According to that resolution, the OSCE Permanent Council adopted Decision No. 305 of 1 July 1999 to establish a mission in Kosovo (<em>OMIK)</em> that would take over from the temporary OSCE Task Force in Kosovo. The decision states that <em>OSCE</em> was to contribute to the stabilisation and development of Kosovo within the framework of the work of <em>UNMIK</em>, especially in the areas of development of institutions and support of democracy and human rights – three areas in which OSCE had considerable experience. The ensuing OSCE mission in Kosovo was dubbed <em>OSCE Mission in Kosovo (OMIK).</em></span></p>"

Personnel working in the mission experienced difficulties and reported persecutions of Kosovo-Albanians. These persecutions led to attacks on Serbian forces by the Kosovo Liberation Army. In the morning of 20 March, <em>OSCE</em> recalled its observers from Kosovo, just a few days before the start of <em>Operation Allied Force</em> in which NATO bombed Serbian targets to compel a peace agreement. <em>KVM</em> found that Kosovo-Albanians in the province were the victims of an extensive and systematic program of persecution.<br />When <em>OSCE</em> returned, now as <em>OMIK</em>, a different challenge was at hand. <em>KFOR </em>had gained control and now was able to assure security, and <em>UNMIK </em>was tasked with setting up a administrative function for Kosovo. The original task for <em>OMIK</em> was to work with <em>UNMIK</em> on building local institutions such as an ombudsman, courts, and police, preferably with staff of multiple ethnicities. Since that time, <em>OSCE</em> has expanded its scope. Today, the work of OSCE in Kosovo encompasses such areas as gender equality, prevention of terrorism, cybersecurity, freedom of the press, and efforts to provide better opportunities for the youth of Kosovo. However, the “traditional” OSCE tasks still play a major role. The mission continues to work on developing the police and the judicial system and in addition focuses on human rights and democratic elections. As an example, observers are present at every election.</span></p>"

                        "text": "<p>The civil war in the former Yugoslavia had its roots in the desire for independence and in related acts of ethnic cleansing. There had been political tensions between the component states in Yugoslavia for years. Acts of war broke out when Croatia and Slovenia seceded from the federation. A significant minority of Serbs lived in the border area in southern Croatia, near Bosnia. They were opposed to Croatia being independent from the federated structure. Armed hostilities erupted between Croat Serbs, supported by the Yugoslav army, and the Croats. The European Community attempted without success to end the fighting. In parallel, the UN had become involved in the conflict and worked to establish a foundation for a solution and, in 1991, to stop the flow of arms and ammunition to the area.  This did not bear fruit, and the next objective was a potential UN operation, initially to bring about a ceasefire. The UN in 1992 set up <em>United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)</em>. Its task was to reinstate peace and provide security in Yugoslavia with an emphasis on the unrest in Croatia. <em>UNPROFOR I </em>was sent to Croatia, <em>UNPROFOR II</em> was sent to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and <em>UNPROFOR III</em> was sent to Macedonia. <em>UNPROFOR I</em> was dissolved in 1995 when the Croatian government no longer permitted the presence of the force in the area. The UN Security Council then decide to restructure <em>UNPROFOR</em> I in Croatian to UNCRO. As successor to <em>UNPROFOR I</em> in Croatia, <em>UNCRO </em>was tasked with setting up a ceasefire between Serbs supporting Yugoslavia and Croats supporting independence for Croatia. The primary task of <em>UNCRO</em> was to establish a peace agreement. This effort was severely hampered when Croat forces in what is known as <em>Operation Storm</em> in the days of 4-7 August 1995 captured two of the four areas under the watch of <em>UNCRO</em> These areas were Danish-patrolled Sector North and Sector West. The Croats thus gained control of the Krajina area, the part of Croatia that had been occupied by Serb forces at the beginning of the war. With the retaking of the Krajina area, the UN forces were no longer needed, and <em>UNCRO</em> was dissolved on 15 January 1996. After the termination of <em>UNCRO</em>, the UN on the last day of work for <em>UNCRO </em>decided to set up an administrative mandate specifically for parts of Croatia.  The peacekeeping force charged with this mandate carried the long name of <em>United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium</em> <em>(UNTAES)</em>. It was the remit of <em>UNTAES</em> to ensure that agreements entered into on 12 November 1995 between the Croatian government and local Serbian authorities in Eastern Slovenia, Baranja, and Western Sirmium were honoured. UNTAES was an observation mission whose main tasks were to monitor compliance with agreements, for example agreements to demilitarise the areas. <em>UNTAES</em>maintained this mandate until 15 January 1998 when the mission was terminated and replaced by a police force by the name of <em>United Nations Police Support Group (UNPSG)</em>. It was to carry out monitoring of and collaboration with Croatian police with respect to control of the areas, hereunder especially the work of registration and management of returning refugees.</p>"

For years, there had been political tensions between the states making up Yugoslavia; when Croatia and Slovenia seceded from the federation, war broke out. In the southern part of Croatia bordering on Bosnia, a significant local minority of Serbs opposed Croatia’s independence from the federated Yugoslavia. Hostilities erupted between the Croatian Serbs – supported by the Yugoslav army – and the Croats. The European Community then unsuccessfully attempted to put an end to the strife. In parallel, the UN had become involved in the conflict and made efforts to build a scenario for halting the unrest. In 1991, the UN in addition worked to block transport of arms and ammunition to the area. These efforts did not meet with success, and talks were held with a view to initiating a UN operation for the purposes of achieving a ceasefire. In 1992, the UN established <em>United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)</em> with the aim of reinstating peace and providing security in Yugoslavia, especially in volatile Croatia. </span><em><span>UNPROFOR I</span></em><span> was sent to Croatia,<em>UNPROFOR II</em> was sent to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and <em>UNPROFOR III</em> was sent to Macedonia. <em>UNPROFOR I</em> was terminated in 1995 when the Croatian government no longer permitted the force to operate in the area. The UN Security Council then approved a restructuring of <em>UNPROFOR</em> into three forces:<em> The United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia</em> <em>(UNCRO)</em> in Croatia;<em> the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force</em> <em>(UNPREDEP)</em> in Macedonia; and <em>UNPROFOR II</em> in Bosnia and Herzegovina (until December 1995). Together, these three forces made up the <em>United Nations Peace Force</em> (<em>UNPF</em>). As successor to <em>UNPROFOR I</em> in Croatia, <em>UNCRO</em> was tasked with establishing a ceasefire between Serbs supporting Yugoslavia and Croats in favour of independence for Croatia. In addition, <em>UNCRO</em> was to monitor and report on all personnel, arms, and other reinforcements transported into Croatia during the conflict. The primary purpose of the mission, however, was to arrange a peace accord. Efforts toward this goal were initiated, but they were severely hampered when Croat forces in what is known as <em>Operation Storm</em> in the days of 4-7 August 1995 captured two of the four areas under the watch of <em>UNCRO</em> These two areas, Sector North and Sector West, were patrolled by the Danes. That capture gave the Croats control over the Krajina area, the Serb-dominated part of Croatia. With the retaking of the Krajina area, the UN forces were no longer needed, and <em>UNCRO</em> was terminated on 15 January 1996. The Danish contingent returned to Denmark starting in October 1995. The last Danish soldier departed from <em>UNCRO</em> on 1 December 1995.</span></p>"

Here, DANBAT 7 and 8 were tasked with: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Monitoring the terrain and the warring parties in and around the border between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.</span></li>\n<li><span>Monitoring compliance with ceasefire agreements. This objective was met only to a limited extent due to certain restrictions imposed on the work.</span></li>\n<li><span>Undertaking humanitarian aid work in Croatia. This objective was met in part.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>In general, the work of police personnel was similar to the work of UNPROFOR. This work included:<br />- Ensuring that local police carried out their functions without discrimination against persons of another nationality and without violations of human rights;<br />- Monitoring the activities of the local police;<br />- Accompanying local police on their patrols and in their local activities; and<br />- Investigating information regarding discrimination and violations of human rights.</span></p>\n<p><span>The work of DANBAT 7 in Croatia was complicated by the runup to and the execution of Operation Storm, an attack by the Croatian army that in August 1995 captured the Krajina area in a matter of days. One Danish soldier was killed, and several were wounded. The armed clashes were intense, and the Danish soldiers got caught in the line of fire between Croat and Krajina-Serb forces. The next contingent, DANBAT 8, similarly experienced hardship in the area. A new offensive and battles between Croats and Bosnian Serbs put Danish positions in the line of fire on 18 September 1995 with heavy shooting from positions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In this hostile encounter, two Danes lost their lives, and many were wounded. DANBAT 8 concluded its decommissioning work in the Krajina area and returned to Denmark in October 1995. After that, Denmark sent observers to Croatia in 1996 within the remit of <em>UN Mission of Observers in Prevlaka (UNMOP</em>) and <em>United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (UNTAES</em>). </span></p>"

Armed hostilities erupted between Croat Serbs, supported by the Yugoslav army, and the Croats. The European Community attempted without success to end the fighting. In parallel, the UN had become involved in the conflict and worked to establish a foundation for a solution and, in 1991, to stop the flow of arms and ammunition to the area.  This did not bear fruit, and the next objective was a potential UN operation, initially to bring about a ceasefire. The UN in 1992 set up <em>United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)</em>. Its task was to reinstate peace and provide security in Yugoslavia with an emphasis on the unrest in Croatia. </span><em><span>UNPROFOR I</span></em><span> was sent to Croatia, <em>UNPROFOR II</em> was sent to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and <em>UNPROFOR III</em> was sent to Macedonia.

The UN Security Council therefore approved a restructuring of <em>UNPROFOR</em> <em>I</em> in Croatia by setting up a new operation named the <em><span>United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia</span></em> <em>(UNCRO) </em>in which the UN observers continued their work. <em>UNCRO</em> was established on <span>31 March 1995 and soon ran into serious problems with the Croats who under <em>Operation Storm</em> retook two of the four areas included in <em>UNCRO</em>. These areas were Sector North and Sector West, patrolled by Danes. That is how the Croats got control of the Krajina area, the part of Croatia that had been occupied by Serb forces at the start of the war. The retaking of the Krajina area led to the dissolution of <em>UNCRO</em> on 15 January 1996. Although the UN soldiers were no longer required, there was still a need for the UN observers in Prevlaka who could no longer operate under the terminated <em>UNCRO</em>. An independent observation mission was set up on 15 January 1996 under the name<em>UN Mission of Observers in Prevlaka</em> <em>(UNMOP</em>). During the time <em>UNMOP</em> operated in Prevlaka, the area remained secure and stable, and the mission was terminated on 15 December 2002.  </span></p>"

These three forces were collectively known as the <em>United Nations Peace Force</em> (<em>UNPF</em>). <em>UNPREDEP, </em>in reality the replacement for <em>MACCOMD/UNPROFOR</em> in Macedonia, was given the task of continuing the work done by <em>UNPROFOR III</em> to prevent the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia from spreading to Macedonia. The units were to patrol the western and northern borders and stabilise the security situation in Macedonia. <em>UNPREDEP </em>in addition was tasked with facilitating dialogue between the various groups at risk of getting into conflict with the others. <em>MACCOMD/UNPROFOR</em> and <em>UNPREDEP </em>were later praised expressly for creating dialogue and for reaching compromises with various segments of society in Macedonia.</span> <br /><span>When <em>UNPREDEP </em>closed itself down on 28 February 1999, Macedonia was still not without conflict. The minority Albanians felt that they were treated as second-class citizens. This brought on armed clashes between Albanians and Macedonian police. To dampen conflict, negotiations between the Macedonian government and Albanian representatives produced a peace agreement, known as the “Ohrid Framework Agreement”, on 13 August 2001. It stipulated that the Albanian resistance movement hand over up to 3,300 weapons for destruction.</span></p>"

After several years of political tension between Yugoslavian states, war broke out in 1991 when Croatia and Slovenia left the Yugoslavian federation, soon followed by Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. War broke out in Croatia as the large Serb minority in the part of the country that bordered Bosnia was in opposition to Croatia’s independence and did not want to become part of the new country. This led to fighting between Croatian units and Croatian Serbs, who were supported by the Yugoslavian army. The same happened in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where Bosnian Serbs and the Yugoslavian army fought against Bosnian troops in an attempt to secure territory for Yugoslavia. While the UN tried to prevent the violent conflicts in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the international community feared that the armed conflict would also escalate to include Macedonia. Macedonia had been able to steer relatively clear of violent confrontation after their referendum on the issue of independence. The UN had already set up the <em>United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)</em>, with <em>UNPROFOR I</em> stationed in Croatia and <em>UNPROFOR II </em>in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This led to the creation of <em>UNPROFOR III</em> in Macedonia, where the force was tasked with preventing an outbreak of hostilities. Unlike <em>UNPROFOR I and II,</em> <em>UNPROFOR III</em> was able to maintain stability in Macedonia. <em>UNPROFOR III</em> was also known as ”<em>Macedonia Command</em>”, the operation often being referred to as <em>MACCOMD/UNPROFOR</em>. <em>UNPROFOR III</em> kept the same designation until 1995, when it was renamed the <em>United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP)</em>, with status as an autonomous mission. When <em>UNDPREDEP </em>was wound down in February 1999 Macedonia was still affected by conflict. Macedonia’s Albanian minority felt treated like second-class citizens, which led to armed conflicts between Albanians and the Macedonian police. Action was required and led to a peace treaty known as the “<em>Ohrid agreement</em>”, concluded on 13 August 2001 by the Macedonian Government and Albanian representatives. The agreement meant that up to 3,300 weapons were handed in for destruction by the Albanian resistance.</span></p>"

These included Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia. Unrest rapidly escalated into armed conflict between the various population groups and soon Bosnians, Croats and Serbs were fighting against each other. After fighting broke out, the European Council negotiated an agreement in 1991 on the creation of an EU force of observers, who would monitor and work to support ceasefire agreements in the regions. This force was named <em>European Community Monitoring Mission (ECMM)</em> and was intended to operate as a neutral unarmed force that could promote dialogue between the various parties, promote the conclusion of treaties and to gather and analyse information about the situation in the various areas. Monitoring of human rights and the needs of the civilian population was given high priority. Initially <em>ECMM</em> was only mandated to operate in Bosnia and Croatia, but the mandate was extended in 1992 to include Bulgaria, Hungary and Albania. This extended mandate was necessary as there was concern that unrest and armed conflict would spread to these countries, where<em> ECMM</em> operated through the 90s and into the new millennium. <em>ECMM</em> was then renamed as <em>European Union Monitoring Mission (EUMM) </em>in 2000. <em> </em>The mission ran until 2007.</span></p>"

The declaration was an agreement between the EU and Yugoslavia, as well as its regions: Serbia, Slovenia and Croatia, who accepted the deployment of EU observers to the various regions. The declaration and mandate were intended to form a basis for negotiations between the conflicted parties. One way this would be achieved would be by concluding long-term ceasefire agreements, with the EU observers as intermediaries. The mandate would have particular focus on Slovenia and Croatia, as this regions were particularly affected by conflict at this time. Even though focus was on those countries, <em>ECMM</em> would also operate in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Here, it would perform tasks such as organising humanitarian convoy routes in and to Bosnia-Herzegovina from Croatia. In this regard, <em>ECMM</em> was authorised to request back up from <em>UNPROFOR II</em> if the presence of UN troops was required during the transport mission.  The mandate for the mission was extended in 1992 to also include Bulgaria, Hungary and Albania and was then extended again on various occasions during the 1990s (including an agreement in the Hague in October 1991) and during the 00s.

Fighting erupted between Croats and Serbs living in the border area between Croatia and Bosnia. The Yugoslavian army actively participated in this war. The European Community undertook several initiatives to end the fighting, but to no avail. Parallel to this, the UN had become involved through a number of meetings with the opposing parties, while also having been able to introduce a number of restrictions in 1991 with regard to the transportation of arms and munitions to Yugoslavia. These meetings did not bear fruit, so a possible UN operation in Yugoslavia was discussed at the same time, focusing initially on a ceasefire. The international community's initial involvement in the Balkans largely took the form of observers who were deployed to inform and report on humanitarian issues and to try and minimise human rights violations.  It was also hoped that the conflicted parties would allow themselves to be demilitarised. Some of these observers were posted by the UN’s <em>Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE/OSCE)</em>, which also saw participation by Danes. The tasks of the observers were very difficult, as the conflict between Serbs, Croats and Bosnians often led to violent confrontations between the opposing factions.

One of the first mandates to support <em>CSCE/OSCE</em> operations in the former Yugoslavia was established in 1992 by <em>The Committee of Senior Officials</em> (<em>CSO</em>), focusing on operations in Kosovo. At that time, Kosovo was still part of Serbia. <em>CSCE/OSCE</em> observers arrived in Kosovo during September 1992, where they would gather information about human rights violations and other issues. They would also gain an overview of Kosovo’s minorities. It was also decided under the same mandate that the <em>CSCE/OSCE</em> observers would be deployed in Macedonia during September 1992. The primary objective here was to prevent the conflict in the former Yugoslavia from spreading to Macedonia, for example by observing activities at the Macedonian border with Serbia to see if there was any activity that might indicate a Serbian involvement in Macedonia. A similar mission was set up under <em>CSCE</em>auspices in Hungary, under British command and known as <em>Sanctions Assistance Mission</em> (<em>SAM)</em>. The task of this mission was to monitor compliance with the trade restrictions that had been introduced against Serbia and Montenegro. The Danish tax, customs and excise authority provided observers for this mission. The Danish tax, customs and excise authority would later deploy personnel to Croatia, to perform the same duties. After these deployments, CSCE/OSCE was mandated by UN Security Resolution 1031 in December 1995 to assist with elections and ensure compliance with the Dayton agreement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  In addition to the presences in Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, agreement was reached with the Croatian government that an OSCE mission would be established in Croatia from July 1996. But the <em>CSCE/OSCE</em> did not stop here. Kosovo was also covered by a new mandate under UN Security Council Resolution 1244 on 10 June 1999. The mandate was the basis for <em>The OSCE Mission in Kosovo</em> (<em>OMIK</em>) from July 1999. The missions in Kosovo concerned the broad but significant investigations of human rights violations, establishing elections and the monitoring of Kosovo as it demilitarised.    </span></p>"

There had been political tensions between the component states in Yugoslavia for years. Acts of war broke out when Croatia and Slovenia seceded from the federation. A significant minority of Serbs lived in the border area in southern Croatia, near Bosnia. They were opposed to Croatia being independent from the federated structure. Armed hostilities erupted between Croat Serbs, supported by the Yugoslav army, and the Croats. The European Community attempted without success to end the fighting. In parallel, the UN had become involved in the conflict and worked to establish a foundation for a solution and, in 1991, to stop the flow of arms and ammunition to the area. This did not bear fruit, and the next objective was a potential UN operation, initially to bring about a ceasefire. The UN in 1992 set up <em>United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)</em>. Its task was to reinstate peace and provide security in Yugoslavia with an emphasis on the unrest in Croatia. </span></p>\n<p><span>The plan for <em>UNPROFOR</em> was based on two key elements: A) Getting the Yugoslav People’s Army (JNA) out of Croatia (it was a key player in the conflict) and putting an end to the military conflicts; and B) supporting and helping local authorities and police in conflict-ridden areas to avoid a failure of local governance. To this end, the <em>United Nations Protected Areas (UNPAs</em>) mission was established, with <em>UNPROFOR </em>having a special mandate. The overall mandate permitted the UN force to disarm the warring parties, control the UNPAs, and support police in protecting human rights and preventing discrimination. In Croatia, the work was done by <em>UNPROFOR I</em>; <em>UNPROFOR II</em> was active in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and <em>UNPROFOR III</em> operated in Macedonia.</span> <span><em>UNPROFOR I</em></span><span> was dissolved in 1995 when the Croatian government no longer permitted the presence of the force in the area.</span><span> The UN </span><span>Security Counciltherefore approved a restructuring of <em>UNPROFOR</em></span> <span>into three forces:</span> <span><em>The United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia</em></span><span> <em>(UNCRO)</em> in Croatia;<em> the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force</em> <em>(UNPREDEP)</em> in Macedonia; and <em>UNPROFOR II</em> continuing in Bosnia and Herzegovina until December 1995.

The mandate was further expanded in 1992 such that <em>UNPROFOR I</em> had authority to control the movements of civilians in and out of the UNPAs for the purpose of managing migration. These initiatives improved the situation temporarily, but new conflicts erupted in 1993 between Serbs and Croats. It was now necessary to intensify the attempts at securing a ceasefire between the warring parties, and yet another mandate was thus approved by Resolution 802 of 25 January 1993.<span>  </span>This attempt failed to bring about a lasting ceasefire, and fighting continued.</p>"

However, in some cases it might be necessary to order the participation of officers and commanders. In 1993, support to <em>UNPROFOR I</em> was increased by adding medical services personnel such as physicians, nurses, and nursing assistants. In addition, capacity was added in the form of armoured cars, armoured mortar sections, and an antitank rocket platoon with TOW missiles. This added capacity included 100 personnel.

The impetus for this was that the UN and NATO would be deploying air support in Croatia as indicated in the proposal: ”When the mandate for <em>UNPROFOR</em> was extended on 31 March 1994 (Resolution 908), the UN Security Council decided to expand the authorisation for providing air support for protection of UN troops during the execution of their mandate such that the authorisation includes Croatian territory”.

Therefore, the UN decided to terminate <em>UNPROFOR I</em>. The Danish soldiers continued under <em>UNCRO</em> as of 31 March 1995. <em>UNCRO</em> ran into serious difficulty when Croatian forces attacked it between 4 and 7 August 1995 in what is known as <em>Operation Storm</em> and took control of two of the four <em>UNCRO</em> areas. These areas were Danish-patrolled Sector North and Sector West. Croatia now had control of the Krajina area, the part of the country that had been occupied by Serbian forces at the beginning of the war. The retaking of the Krajina area obviated the need for the UN forces, and the Danes were recalled from <em>UNCRO</em> in October 1995. The last Danish soldier left the area on 1 December 1995. As for <em>UNPROFOR II</em> in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the operation continued until 20 December 1995 when it was terminated by the Dayton Agreement. <em>UNPROFOR III</em> in Macedonia ended on 31 March 1995. According to the UN, <em>UNPROFOR III</em> was terminated when Macedonia requested a restructuring of the existing size and makeup of <em>UNPROFOR</em>. <em>UNPROFOR III</em> was restructured, and the new operation was named the <em>United Nations Preventive Deployment Force </em>(<em>UNPREDEP)</em>. The Danes working in <em>UNPROFOR III</em> transitioned to <em>UNPREDEP</em> as of 31 March 1995. They stayed in <em>UNPREDEP</em> until 23 March 1999, one month after its termination.</span></p>"

There had been political tensions between the component states in Yugoslavia for years. Acts of war broke out when Croatia and Slovenia seceded from the federation. A significant minority of Serbs lived in the border area in southern Croatia, near Bosnia. They were opposed to Croatia being independent from the federated structure. Armed hostilities erupted between Croat Serbs, supported by the Yugoslav army, and the Croats. The European Community attempted without success to end the fighting. In parallel, the UN had become involved in the conflict and worked to establish a foundation for a solution and, in 1991, to stop the flow of arms and ammunition to the area.  This did not bear fruit, and the next objective was a potential UN operation, initially to bring about a ceasefire. The UN in 1992 set up <em>United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)</em>. Its task was to reinstate peace and provide security in Yugoslavia. </span><span>Initially, <em>UNPROFOR</em> entered Croatia, but it was soon apparent that more was needed if there were to be any sustained hope of peace in a Yugoslavia plagued by civil war. Thus <em>UNPROFOR</em> was expanded to include Bosnia and Herzegovina under the name <em>UNPROFOR II</em>. There were many challenges here – key among them the clashes and hostilities between Bosnian Muslims and Croats and between these and the Bosnian Serbs who enjoyed significant support in the Serbian state within Yugoslavia, not to mention the critical humanitarian situation for civilians. As the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina did not improve, Denmark (and the UN) in 1994 for the first time decided to use heavy weapons, in the form of an tank squadron, in a peacekeeping mission. <em>UNPROFOR II</em> in Bosnia and Herzegovina was terminated in December 1995 upon the signing in Paris of the Dayton Agreement, a treaty between Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia, on 14 December 1995. The goal had been to halt the armed conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina that had gone on for three and a half years. In an effort to cement compliance with the agreement, the tasks were now transferred to NATO in operation <em>Implementation Force (IFOR).</em></span></p>"

Initially, the mandate was aimed at Croatia, but once <em>UNPROFOR I</em> was set up, it was expanded several times. When conflicts escalated from Croatia across its borders, the mandate was expanded to include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Serbia, and Montenegro. UN Security Council Resolution 758 of 8 June 1992 included a separate humanitarian mandate to place the Sarajevo airport under UN control and protection. This airport was key to the mission in that humanitarian aid landed here for distribution to areas in need within Yugoslavia. The warring parties agreed to offer protection to the personnel distributing aid to civilians. One early achievement was an agreement to transfer control of the Sarajevo airport from Bosnian Serbs to the UN. This agreement was soon breached by fighting between Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian forces in the area around the airport. This was a complication for the overall UN effort and necessitated a significant presence of forces to protect the airport. The mandate came from UN Security Council Resolution 758 of 8 June 1992. </span></p>\n<p><span>Humanitarian work was at risk of attack not just in the Sarajevo airport. Therefore, the UN Security Council approved a special humanitarian aid mandate (Resolution 776 of 14 September 1992) to enable <em>UNPROFOR II</em> to protect humanitarian aid organisations such as the United Nations Refugee Agency UNHCR and the Red Cross. The mandate further provided that <em>UNPROFOR II</em> was authorised to engage in self defence if it or the humanitarian convoys were fired on during transport of emergency aid. </span></p>\n<p><span>Later, the UN approved a peacekeeping mandate (Resolution 787 of 16 November 1992) to have the borders of Bosnia and Herzegovina controlled by UN soldiers and observers for the purpose of seizing weapons and explosives before they entered the country.<br />By UN Resolution 824 of 6 May 1993, the so-called ”safe zones” were designated, primarily for the Muslim population, in the municipalities of Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde, Bihac, and Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</span></p>"

Formal comments appended to the proposal noted that the impetus was an expansion of the mandate of <em>UNPROFOR II</em> within UNPAs (United Nations Protected Areas) around several mostly Muslim municipalities (the so-called ”safe zones”). UN forces would thus be authorised to use force to defend against attacks on the safe zones. The Nordic countries jointly offered the UN a Nordic force named NORDBAT II including a tank squadron numbering 115 personnel. In addition, personnel were offered to perform coordination of support from NATO planes. Proposal B107 was approved on 17 August 1993 with 105 votes in favour, 17 votes opposed, and 1 vote undecided.<br />That year, Denmark in addition decided to expand the headquarters company of <em>UNPROFOR</em> in Bosnia and Herzegovina in order to enhance its capacity in medical services and armoured transport and to improve the safety of personnel and the ability to mount close range defence.

Numerous people were killed when the army and Soviet tanks opened fire on those demonstrating. This led to increased demonstrations throughout Hungary.<br />On 1 November, Imre Nagy’s government announced that Hungary had cancelled its membership of the Warsaw Pact. On 3 November, the government and the Soviet authorities agreed that Soviet forces would leave Hungary by 15 January 1957.<br />At dawn on 4 November, Soviet troops invaded Hungary. Hungarian resistance ceased after a few days of fighting.<br />The consequences were mass arrests and approximately 200,000 people fled the country. Extreme measures were also taken that greatly reduced the population’s freedom of movement. Just a few months after the revolution all popular opposition had been crushed.</p>"

Borders were closed and public communications were shut down. Manufacture and electrical supply were reduced. After just a few weeks, supplies of everyday necessities and medicines were so low that it became necessary to request foreign aid because of the risk of famine, which would be fatal to children and the elderly.<br />On 18 December 1981, Danish Red Cross asked the Danish government and the Emergency Management Agency to provide vehicles and personnel for emergency aid transport shipments to Poland.</p>"

It was based in the Bosnian town of Zenica.<br />The unit was comprised of 12 Mercedes Benz 911 lorries and two Toyota Landcruiser light vehicles. The unit also brought with it a complete workshop to support the operation and maintenance of the vehicle pool. When on convoy missions, the unit was escorted by British armoured vehicles. The smaller lorries turned out to be particularly well-suited to driving on the poor quality roads in mountainous areas.<br />Drivers were mainly recruited from recalled conscripts. Each team had 18 drivers. There was also a leadership group and a five-strong workshop squad. Personnel were recruited locally as required.<br />A new team of drivers and officers continued the transport mission at the beginning of May 1993. For the first month there were no notable problems apart from uncertainty about the military situation in the country.<br />1 June 1993 saw an atrocity that became a dark day in the history of the Emergency Management Agency.<br />The convoy that was sent from Zenica to the town of Maglaj was comprised of nine lorries, each packed with emergency aid for the UNHCR’s (UN High Commissioner for Refugees) stores, a convoy leader vehicle and two passenger vehicles. The unit was escorted by three British tanks. Maglaj had been shelled by artillery earlier that morning. The situation was now calm and the first two lorries and the convoy leader drove to the storage facility in Maglaj. The rest of the convoy was parked in a road tunnel approximately 5 km (3 miles) from the town. During unloading, the town was shelled and the population took cover.<br />Meanwhile, the vehicles in the tunnel came under fire before the personnel were able to reach safety in the escort vehicles. Two Danish drivers and a local interpreter were killed in this attack. Two people were badly injured and four of the other drivers received minor lacerations. The wounded were taken in the British tanks to the local hospital in Zenica where their injuries were treated. The wounded were later diagnosed by Danish doctors and were sent back home for treatment in Denmark.<br />Emergency aid convoy operations continued until mid-1995 after the security situation had improved greatly.<br />Two emergency aid experts were also sent from Denmark to support the UN and the International Red Cross. The Emergency Management Agency deployed a total of 173 personnel over the duration of the entire mission.</p>"

They culminated at the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia held in 1990 to address and solve the problems in the country. No agreement could be reached, however, and several delegations abandoned the Congress. During the year, a multi-party election was held for the first time. Nationalist parties achieved popular support. On 25 July 1991, Slovenia and Croatia declared independence. There was considerable unrest in the multi-ethnic state Bosnia-Herzegovina. <br />In August of that year, Slovenia won independence after a war lasting just 10 days. Meanwhile, Croatia found itself in a protracted war of independence fought against the Yugoslav government in Belgrade and against the minority population of Krajina Serbs who wished to remain in Yugoslavia. As the EC and the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) attempted to negotiate ceasefires, the international community watched with alarm as Bosnia-Herzegovina came ever closer to a total breakdown, Macedonia wanted independence, and the government in Belgrade tried to clamp down on the independence movements.</p>"

Resolution 713 (1991) condemned acts of war, encouraged implementation of the ceasefire being negotiated by the EC, and prohibited all imports of arms and war materiel to Yugoslavia’s states and the remaining federation.<br />Although a ceasefire between Croatia and Yugoslavia finally came about at the beginning of 1992, a referendum in Bosnia-Herzegovina had resulted in a majority vote for independence. The referendum, however, was boycotted by the large Serbian minority in the country. In May, when the hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina escalated significantly, the embargo was extended by Resolution 757 (1992). It sanctioned the rest of Yugoslavia by prohibiting all imports and exports except for humanitarian aid, i.e. food and medicine.<br />Neither Resolution 713 (1991) nor the even more restrictive Resolution 757 (1992) contained a mandate to enforce the embargo. The Security Council imposed a demand on all UN member countries to cease trading with Yugoslavia, but did not implement any process to ensure compliance. That is why the UN on 15 June requested that NATO provide surveillance in the Adriatic Sea. The NATO Standing Naval Force Mediterranean, STANAVFORMED, was therefore deployed with <em>Operation Maritime Monitor.</em> In November, the mandate was further expanded by Resolution 787 (1992) authorising inspections and boarding of ships suspected of breaking the embargo. At that point, Maritime Monitor was terminated and replaced by Operation Maritime Guard.</p>"

As a result, it was difficult to succeed with the embargo. <em>Niels Juel</em> and the rest of STANAVFORLANT therefore took up position at the entry to the Adriatic Sea and hailed all merchant vessels to request information about their cargo and destination. Then, the ships were monitored to determine if they had provided accurate information. Should this not be the case, there was, however, no way to intervene physically. The only option was to inform the UN so that it could issue a protest to the countries in which the ships were registered. In time, the mandate was expanded, and Danish ships took part later in <em>Operation Sharp Guard</em>, where it was easier to enforce the blockade through the use of force against ships attempting to break the embargo.</p>"

No agreement could be reached, however, and several delegations walked out of the Congress. During the year, a multi-party election was held for the first time. Nationalist parties achieved popular support. On 25 July 1991, Slovenia and Croatia declared independence. There was considerable unrest in the multi-ethnic state Bosnia-Herzegovina. <br />In August of that year, Slovenia won independence while Croatia found itself in a protracted war of independence fought against the Yugoslav government in Belgrade and against the minority population of Serbs in the Republic of Krajina, a part of Croatia. This minority wished to remain in Yugoslavia. As the EC and the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) attempted to negotiate ceasefires, the international community watched with alarm as Bosnia-Herzegovina came ever closer to a total breakdown, Macedonia wanted independence, and the government in Belgrade tried to clamp down on the independence movements.<br />In hopes of preventing war, the UN Security Council decided to limit access to arms. Based on Resolutions 713 (1991) and 757 (1992), an arms embargo and sanctions against Yugoslavia and the seceding republics were initiated. NATO monitored the embargo through <em>Operation Maritime Monitor</em>. Denmark supplied a corvette.</span></p>"

That made it easier to maintain a full blockade of maritime traffic with an exception for ships carrying humanitarian aid.

The primary purpose was to monitor maritime traffic in the Adriatic Sea. Of course, the overall threat level and the operating conditions were quite different given that the job involved keeping up an armed embargo in the waters off the coast of a country in the midst of a civil war. The scale of the operation was larger, too, in that there are not as many occasions to hail and board ships when patrolling the waters “at home” where there is no blockade to maintain. Recent experience gained by <em>Olfert Fischer</em> in <em>Operation Faraway </em>in the Persian Gulf came in handy. That mission had been similar and likewise featured close collaboration with other NATO ships.<br />Since the Danish corvettes did not carry helicopters as did many of the larger NATO ships, boarding was possible only by using a rubber dinghy. During a boarding, 8-10 men guarded the ship’s crew, secured the bridge, and searched the cargo. The corvette was oriented to ensure its weapons systems could cover the boarding team in case of difficulties.<br />In total, 629 ships were hailed by the three Danish vessels during the operation; 124 were boarded and inspected, and 10 were redirected. The corvettes did not discover any blockade runners. The overall operation discovered just 11. This result is likely due to the deterrent effect of the large and armed international naval force in <em>Operation Sharp Guard</em></span></p>"

American President George W. Bush believed that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein might see the potential of supplying this type of arms to terror organisations like Al-Qaeda. Hussein was hostile to the USA after it had driven the Iraqi army out of Kuwait in 1991 and had maintained sanctions and no-fly zones over Iraq ever since. The Iraqi dictator has previously been willing to use poison gas against his own population.<br />During the 1990s the UN’s weapons inspectors had been destroying Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction as part of the 1991 post-war ceasefire. Iraq had been unwilling, however, to fully cooperate with the weapons inspectors and there was therefore a suspicion that arms depots or production facilities were still in existence. It was a matter of great discussion in Denmark and the international community whether Iraq was concealing weapons of mass destruction, had links to terror and whether the UN resolutions from the 1990s mandated an intervention. A UN commission was sent to Iraq to investigate.<br />The commission found no weapons of mass destruction but reported a continued lack of willingness to cooperate, Because of the arguments about weapons of mass destruction, links to terror, the unwillingness to cooperate and a general desire to bring down Saddam Hussein and introduce democracy, a U.S. -led coalition was set up in 2003 called <em>Operation Iraqi Freedom</em>, in which Denmark would participate. It took only a few weeks to bring down Saddam Hussein’s régime, but a longer project lay ahead. The coalition set up a provisional government that came to be known by the acronym CPA (Coalition Provisional Authority). One of the things the CPA did was to dissolve the Iraqi army, which meant that a large multinational force was necessary to maintain law and order in the country until a new Iraqi government could be convened and local forces could be trained to take care of Iraq’s national security.</span></p>"

Legal experts evaluated the mandate as being adequate, but others were in opposition.<br />On 22 May, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1483 (2003), which imposed responsibilities on the coalition forces as an occupying power under international law, repealed previous sanctions against Iraq and recognised the Iraqi governing council under CPA as Iraq’s legitimate representatives towards the international community.  On 16 October, a further resolution (1511 of 2003) recommended that UN member states should contribute to the international force in order to ensure security and stability in Iraq until the country had recovered.</span></p>"

When it was adopted after a vote of 89 for and 15 against, the Parliament approved the deployment of a Danish force of up to 380 troops in Iraq for up to half a year.<br />The case was debated once again half a year later. Because the original period was about to expire, the new UN Security Council resolution 1483 was this time named in the proposal and it was decided at the same time that the Danish contribution would be strengthened.

The first Danish force was comprised of a light reconnaissance group, a medical platoon, a mine-clearing section and a so-called CIMIC unit for civilian-military collaboration. Also deployed were staff and liaison personnel, a logistics detachment and a national support team, as well as a smaller special forces detachment for bodyguard duties and to serve as reinforcements. A detachment of engineers was also deployed for a brief period to construct camps.<br />Because the security situation was not improving, the Government alongside the Foreign Policy Committee decided on 16 July to reinforce the Danish contribution by 40 personnel, mainly military police, an extra scouting section and extra personnel for the logistics unit. The force was increased once again in October 2003 with Proposal B1, this time by 90 men in the form of a reduced armoured infantry company, a detachment of engineers, five staff officers and ten soldiers with special training as bodyguards and two armoured civilian vehicles were provided for Danish civilian representatives in Iraq. The total Danish military contribution thus numbered 510 personnel. The contribution from Lithuania had, in the meantime, grown to 55 men.</span></p>\n<p><span>Denmark sent 3 police advisers and 11 police instructors who were deployed in the same area as the military contribution near Basra. A Danish team of experts was also deployed to locate and map the location of mass graves.</span></p>\n<p><span>Danish Emergency Management Agency personnel were also deployed during the period 21 April to 4 September 2003 to set up and equip various office facilities in Basrah for use by the <em>UN Office for the Humanitarian Coordination in Iraq (UNOHCI)</em> and to perform the office’s functions for a shorter duration during the start-up phase.</span></p>"

A team of elite Jaeger soldiers had already been deployed in April to reconnoitre the area that would possibly become the responsibility of the Danish contingent.<br />The occupation ended on 30 June 2004 when a sovereign Iraqi government was set up.

An extension of this mission was to produce a safe framework for civilian authorities, the UN’s aid mission and rebuilding Iraq’s infrastructure. The 15-strong CIMIC unit also served as a liaison with emergency aid organisations and as a contact interface for local authorities.  The military police personnel who had been deployed trained local Iraqi police and security forces so that they would, ideally, be able to assume responsibility for security when it was time for the Danish force to return home.<br />As part of the British-led force in Southern Iraq near Basra, the Danes were assigned their own area of responsibility which covered approx. 3,600 square kilometres, centred around the town of al-Qurnah, situated where the Tigris and Euphrates rivers meet. According to local legend, this was supposedly the location of the biblical Garden of Eden. The Danish camp was therefore named “Camp Eden”. There was also a Danish Camp Yggdrasil which was part of the British Shaiba Logistics Base close to Basra itself, where the Danish logistics and liaison teams spent most of their time.<br />Regular duties were mainly to patrol the area, set up checkpoints and control posts and to maintain contact with local authorities/police stations. Additional duties included escorting representatives of a number of Danish or international authorities, including civilians working on the reconstruction. The forces were also deployed to support Danish, British or Iraqi forces if they faced a potential or actual attack. Finally, the contingent carried out various larger operations to search areas or a particular village to confiscate illegal weapons or to arrest known or presumed criminals.<br />During the initial period, an important task was to prevent looting or to get back objects that had previously been stolen or robbed. Many vehicles belonging to the authorities had been stolen when the régime collapsed. DANCON confiscated many such vehicles and returned them to the new authorities as they began to be set up. Another important task was to maintain the repaired infrastructure that was often vandalised and looted. Electricity pylons were often toppled by locals who stole the cables and sold the metal on the black market.<br />As part of the British-led multinational division, there was a close partnership with British forces in the area, extensive exchange of experiences and close coordination of missions in the area.</span></p>"

At this time the Danish forces were: an armoured infantry company, a light reconnaissance group, a staff and logistics company, a detachment of engineers, a detachment of military police, a medical platoon, a civilian-military collaboration group, a national support group and a staff and staff officers. Additional to this main contribution to the multinational division that was under British command, ten staff officers were also adjoined to a multinational division under Polish command. Finally, 17 soldiers with specialist bodyguard training were assigned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark’s civilian representations in Baghdad and Basra. Danish special forces also took part in 2007 to reinforce the various units. The Danish National Police has also sent 11 police trainers to Iraq on an ongoing basis.<br />DANCON/IRAQ was split into teams that each served for a half year. After 2007, when the bulk of the troops were withdrawn, a small number of Danish soldiers remained as part of NATO’s training mission in Iraq. During the summer of 2007, this force was comprised of 10 trainers and seven bodyguards. When these were withdrawn as the final remaining contingent in December 2011, the contribution was six personnel for the training mission.<br />A contribution of 55 soldiers from Lithuania was assigned to the Danish forces in Southern Iraq. As part of the British-led multinational division, the Danish-Lithuanian forces often operated very closely with British and Iraqi units.<br />Danish Fennec helicopters and their 55-strong flight and ground crews were also deployed for various periods. The first helicopter deployment was during the 2005 elections, when the three helicopters provided support for the Danish forces. In the second half of 2007 four helicopters and 50 flight and ground crew were deployed to support coalition members after the Danish combat troops had returned home. Danish special forces were also deployed periodically to Iraq.

With the new UN Security Council resolution and Iraq’s independence, the Danish forces continued their presence after 30 June 2004 with a new mandate. The Danish presence was no longer an occupying force after this date, but an international security force that had been invited by the Iraqi government.<br />After negotiations with the United Kingdom in 2006/2007, the Danish Government announced in February that DANCON/IRAQ would withdraw from Iraq during the coming summer, alongside a gradual winding down of the British contribution. Apart from the bodyguard team that was still assigned to the Danish representation in Iraq and the contributions to NATO’s training mission, the final ground units withdrew from Iraq across the border with Kuwait on 7 August. The Danish helicopter contribution then began to fly surveillance missions on behalf of the British and American forces before returning home at the end of the year. The Danish contribution to NATO’s training measures in Iraq remained in place until November 2011, when the final Danish troops were recalled.<br />One Danish contribution had to return to Iraq 2014 under different circumstances, this time as part of the war against ISIL in<em> Operation Inherent Resolve.</em></span></p>"

                        "text": "<p><span>Although the mandate was new, the situation for Danish troops during the transition to an independent Iraq was essentially the same as before. The main objective was to establish security and stability so that the transition towards a democratic system and the various rebuilding projects could both continue. The main missions were to secure frameworks for civilian authorities, the UN aid mission, the rebuilding of Iraq’s infrastructure and, not least, to train Iraqi security forces. The CIMIC unit also served as a liaison with emergency aid organisations and as a contact interface for local authorities. The military police personnel were deployed to assist in training local Iraqi police to be able to work alongside the Danish forces in the area of operations and, ideally, assume full responsibility for security when it was time for the Danish mission to return home. Especially after the launch of the Danish “collaborative thinking initiative” in 2004, humanitarian and reconstruction work became a bigger task.<br />Regular duties were mainly to patrol the area, set up checkpoints and control posts and to maintain contact with local authorities. Additional duties included escorting representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and civilians from the international community who were working on the reconstruction. The forces were also deployed to support Danish, British or Iraqi forces if they faced a potential or actual attack. Finally, in coordination with Iraqi forces, the contingent carried out various larger operations to search areas or a particular village to confiscate illegal weapons or to arrest known or presumed criminals or insurgents. After the transition to a sovereign state, DANCON no longer was in command of Iraqi units and had to perform its duties through a process of coordination and collaboration with them instead.</span></p>\n<p><span>The area for which the Danes were responsible increased dramatically shortly after the transition to Iraqi sovereignty. On 31 August 2004, Denmark was assigned responsibility for an area totalling 17,000 square kilometres. Two battalions from the newly-formed Iraqi national guard and periodically assigned British units were also under Danish command and coordination. Because the Danish Camp Eden was now located at the northern end of the area for which the Danes were responsible, the Danish forces relocated in September to a new base called Camp Danevang, which was an extension of the former Camp Yggdrasil. This was part of the British Shaiba Logistics Base, south-west of Basra. The British forces wound down the Shaiba Logistics Base in 2006 and the Danes relocated with them to Basra Air Station, where they set up Camp Einherjer.<br />The security situation did not improve, despite Iraq having formally declared independence. Ambushes and roadside IED bombings were still the most significant threat and they increased in frequency. Rocket attacks on the Danish base were becoming more regular, despite the fact that they seldom had any effect. As a countermeasure, the Danish forces and their allies carried out several operations which would involve encircling an area or a village and conducting house to house searches for illegal arms and where the Iraqis would themselves arrest those they suspected of being responsible for the attacks.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Fennec helicopters that had been deployed mainly flew surveillance missions. Three helicopters were deployed to support the Danish forces for the first time during the 2005 elections. Four helicopters were deployed in 2007 at the same time as the Danish ground forces were being recalled. Their main mission was to fly surveillance missions for British and American supply convoys as they drove through Iraq from Kuwait.</span></p>"

After the war with Iran during the 1980s, the invasion of Kuwait and the war against the American-led coalition in Operation Desert Storm, a number of rebellions and extensive sanctions against the country during the 1990s and the invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003, much of Iraq's infrastructure lay in ruins. Access to basic essentials was limited and a centralised government was struggling to get up from its knees. As a consequence of war, sanctions, looting and the former régime’s bad governance, the health and education systems were virtually non-existent in large areas of the country. Even essentials like clean drinking water were also in short supply.<br />A number of measures were set in motion at local and international level. The UN set up the <em>UNAMI</em> mission. Donor conferences were conducted, and a number of NGOs began to operate in Iraq. Countries that had been part of the coalition that had toppled Saddam’s régime and were now responsible for Iraq’s security now wanted to start a broad process of rebuilding and securing humanitarian conditions for the Iraqi people.<br />The UN’s mission in Iraq had already been hit by a large bombing attack in August 2003. The Red Cross headquarters in Iraq would also be bombed. Because of the unstable security situation, the multinational security force, including the Danish military contribution, was closely involved in both rebuilding projects and humanitarian work. This was initially in the form of protection and escort missions to protect civilians who had been sent to Iraq by states or NGOs and from CIMIC (the civilian-military partnership). The security situation continued to deteriorate and there were attacks on civilian aid workers. Many NGOs, state organisations and UN agencies withdrew their personnel from the country or concentrated them in a few secure zones, such as “the Green Zone” in Baghdad. The military forces found themselves with increased responsibility for the performance of a number of humanitarian and rebuilding tasks.</span></p>"

It was already emphasised in this first decision that the Danish contribution should not only be military, but that it should also promote security in Iraq and assist with the humanitarian situation and reconstruction, as well as the political process. DKK 350 million was assigned for the reconstruction of Iraq during the following year. The soldiers that were deployed would be able to support humanitarian work and the force’s CIMIC units would establish contact with aid organisations and local authorities and would itself complete smaller scale aid projects. It was intended from the very beginning that the Danish military and humanitarian contribution would focus on Southern Iraq, so that the various sections could support each other. “No reconstruction without security - and no security unless we rebuild.”</span></p>\n<p><span>The subsequent proposal to extend the mission would see the reiteration of the same ideas, and the ongoing addition of further funding for the humanitarian mission. Because of the unstable security situation, many aid organisations had withdrawn and the military contribution had assumed increased responsibility for rebuilding and humanitarian aid.  The Danish Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs therefore launched the “<em>collaborative thinking initiative</em>” in 2004. With its full title, ”Collaborative Thinking for Civilian-military Missions in International Operations” established the framework for collaborations between civilian humanitarian organisations, Danish developmental aid and military forces, also including how advisers could be assigned to a military force and how funding could be assigned to the military to perform civilian tasks if the security situation did not permit civilian stakeholders to operate in the area.<br />Proposal B42 of 2004 was adopted by the Parliament on 25 November, with 97 votes in favour and 15 votes against. This extended the military contribution and, as an extension of the Collaborative Thinking Initiative, also increased the focus of the military units that had been deployed towards more traditional civilian missions. It was noted in the wording of the proposal that the security situation in Southern Iraq was making work difficult for the humanitarian organisations and that the military contribution would be involved in civilian missions to a greater degree than previously. The proposal also increased funding for humanitarian projects that were to be implemented in collaboration with local authorities and contractors. It was hoped that this would normalise conditions for the civilian population and this reduce resistance to the international coalition forces.</span></p>"

It was hoped that if the local population was able to experience improved social and economic conditions, then it would promote greater goodwill towards the presence of the international forces and bring about a long-term contribution towards the stabilisation process.<br />The funding from Denmark was used to start building new schools, water purification plants, healthcare clinics and to rebuild important infrastructures such as roads and bridges, as well as various workplaces that were particularly aimed at women. This all went on with as much collaboration as possible from local stakeholders. Local town councils and sheiks assisted in designating projects and local contractors were hired wherever possible to carry out the construction projects. By engaging the population in these projects, it was hoped that Iraq would have a better basis for continuing the process after the foreign aid had been downscaled or departed.<br />The CIMIC team initially coordinated activities with local stakeholders and international organisations from the Danish CIMIC building in the town of Al-Qurnah. This turned out to be somewhat risky as the security situation deteriorated. In May 2004 the Sheik who had been working closely with the Danish CIMIC unit was murdered. The culprits were in all likelihood militiamen who were trying to deter collaboration with the coalition forces. The CIMIC building was unfortunately taken down the following month.<br />In practical terms, RUD typically operated as two-person teams that drove out to visit projects that had been started with Danish funding or to coordinate issues such as selecting new projects with local dignitaries. The security situation necessitated escort duties that were performed by the reconnaissance group or the armed infantry units from DANCON. This was not always viewed positively by the locals. The CIMIC and RUD units both had to take a critical stance on what local leaders were recommending and when following up projects that had already been started. Numerous inspections were a necessity.<br />In addition to setting up numerous schools and healthcare clinics, the Danish reconstruction mission also helped to distribute food and medicines, set up a centre for torture victims in Basra, assisted returning refugees and implemented leadership training courses for newly-elected politicians and police commissioners.  Other tasks that were performed during this period included excavating mass graves, irrigation projects and supplying equipment ranging from hospital hardware to sewage sludge suction vehicles.</span></p>"

In June, Mosul, the third largest city in Iraq, fell to ISIL. Building on the success, it controlled a large swath of eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq – mostly thinly populated desert areas, but including several large cities such as Fallujah, Mosul, and Tikrit in Iraq and cities such as Raqqa and Palmyra in Syria. <br />Mosul and the surrounding areas were home to some of the oldest Christian communities and the Yazidi minority. <br />Close to 50,000 Yazidis had fled to Mount Sinjar when ISIL advanced and were trapped there in late summer while ISIL waited for them to die of hunger and heat. On 7 August, U.S. President Barack Obama therefore announced the first step in a return to Iraq by the United States. It involved a bombardment of ISIL in order to protect the Yazidis and an air drop of emergency aid for the many refugees. <br />A new coalition was formed to fight ISIL. Participants included the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Jordan, Morocco, and Denmark. Its work was launched in October under the name <em>Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR)</em> Rather than to deploy ground troops, the intent was to fight ISIL from the air. Participating countries sent a number of individuals to Iraq to advise and train its army. Some countries have had ground troops in Iraq to fight ISIL directly. <br />The clashes between ISIL and the coalition created a humanitarian catastrophe for the local population. Therefore, the UN requested support for an enhanced humanitarian effort in northern Iraq.</p>"

On this occasion, it expressed consent for the US to lead the joint international effort against the Islamic State.

The Danish aircraft, this time, were similarly active in the full gamut of air operations, however with a mandate to carry out operations against ISIL positions within both Iraqi and Syrian territories. The contribution was made from July to December 2016.<br />Denmark contributed a C-130J (Hercules) transport plane from June to December 2016 with a crew of approximately 60 persons. In addition, during the period 1 October 2018 to 30 March 2019, a transport plane and 30 personnel were provided to the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait.<br />Since January 2016, the Air Control Wing of the Royal Danish Air Force has contributed to Operation Inherent Resolve by providing a long-range mobile radar and associated personnel. The contribution includes 30 personnel, among them 10 technical specialists operating the radar. It is stationed at the Al Asad Air Base in Iraq along with other components of the Danish contribution. Approximately 20 operators are attached to the radar contribution stationed at the air operations centre at the Al Dhafra Air Base in the United Arab Emirates. With the radar, Air Control Wing supplies the primary and most operationally stable radar image of southern Iraq for the benefit of the entire OIR mission. As described above, the Danish radar operators coordinate the coalition’s flight operations, manned and unmanned, and handle overall flight safety in such activities as aerial refueling and maintenance of distance between aircraft to avoid collision. In 2017, the operational area of responsibility for the radar contribution was expanded to include the southern and central parts of Iraq and parts of eastern Syria. The mobile radar was deployed in the operation until April 2019.</p>\n<p>A Danish special operations contribution (Task Force 61) from the Jaeger Corps was active in the fight against ISIL between August 2016 and November 2018.

In addition, the contribution has a mandate to provide escorts for operations performed in the border area between Iraq and Syria. The special forces were stationed at the Al Asad Air Base along with the Danish radar and capacity contributions.</p>\n<p>The 22 IT and communications specialists from the Deployable Communication Module (DCM), a part of the command structure in NATO, were provided between late August 2018 and the end of December 2018 to establish communications capability between NATO facilities in Iraq and the NATO headquarters in Europe.

In June, Mosul, the third largest city in Iraq, fell to ISIL. Building on the success, it controlled a large swath of eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq – mostly thinly populated desert areas, but including several large cities such as Fallujah, Mosul, and Tikrit in Iraq and cities such as Raqqa and Palmyra in Syria. <br />Mosul and the surrounding areas were home to some of the oldest Christian communities and the Yazidi minority. <br />Close to 50,000 Yazidis had fled to Mount Sinjar when ISIL advanced and were trapped there in late summer while ISIL waited for them to die of hunger and heat. On 7 August, US President Barack Obama therefore announced the first step in a return to Iraq by the United States. It involved a bombardment of ISIL in order to protect the Yazidis and an air drop of emergency aid for the many refugees. <br />A new coalition was formed to fight ISIL. Participants included the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Jordan, Morocco, and Denmark. Its work was launched in October under the name Operation Inherent Resolve Rather than to deploy ground troops, the intent was to fight ISIL from the air. Participating countries sent a number of individuals to Iraq to advise and train its army. Some countries have had ground troops in Iraq to fight ISIL directly.</p>"

Bush with approximately 70 operational aircraft on board and a crew of about 7,500. <br />Peter Willemoes sailed toward the Mediterranean at the end of January. There, it joined the American forces in a training mission while awaiting the decision of Parliament. She had previously, in 2016, been part of a training exercise with the American navy off the eastern seaboard of the US. Then, the frigate provided escort to the aircraft carrier group on the way to the Persian Gulf where the carrier was to support the fight against ISIL in Iraq and Syria and support the international maritime coalition forces known as Combined Maritime Forces.<br />It was a first for the Royal Danish Navy to provide a vessel to an American aircraft carrier group. In total, the Danish contribution included 131 personnel. <br />During the 94 days of the mission, Peter Willemoes covered 28,200 nautical miles (52,100 km / nearly 32,375 miles). More than 300 landings on deck were performed by maritime helicopters.</p>"

In the summer of 2017, ISIL was driven from Mosul, and in October, its capital Raqqa in Syria was lost.<br />On 9 December 2017, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared that the Islamic State was definitively defeated in Iraq and that all its territory had been retaken. Remnants of ISIL, however, have been able to carry out isolated terrorist attacks, for example with suicide bombs in Baghdad in early 2018.

In the summer of 2017, ISIL was driven from Mosul.<br />On 9 December 2017, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared that the Islamic State was definitively defeated in Iraq and that all its territory had been retaken. Remnants of ISIL, however, have been able to carry out isolated terrorist attacks, for example with suicide bombs in Baghdad in early 2018. The last remaining pockets of ISIL were eliminated in 2019.<br />With the contested areas under Kurdish control, the Kurdistan Regional Government in 2017 held a referendum on Kurdish independence. In the referendum, more than 90 % voted for independence from Iraq. The Iraqi government declared the referendum invalid and initiated an offensive against the contested areas now under Kurdish control.<br />In the course of a few months, the Iraqi army regained control of the territory lost to the Peshmerga. </p>"

Because Macedonia’s population was primarily comprised of Slavic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians, there was some concern among the various parties that there would be unrest if the Albanian parties’ demands for equality were not satisfied. These fears became reality when violent conflict broke out between Slavic Macedonians and ethnic Albanians in the second half of 2000. The opposing groups were, however, able to agree a ceasefire on 6 July 2001. After the ceasefire was agreed, the Macedonian government would reassert its authority in the whole of Macedonia, which would be achieved by measures such as a multi-ethnic police force and the handover of weapons by the various ethnic factions. European observers from <em>Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe(OSCE</em>) and<em>European Union Monitoring Mission</em>(<em>EUMM</em>) were deployed to inspect compliance with the ceasefire and to assist in putting necessary structures into place in the country. On 19 September 2002, Macedonia’s President Crvenkovski, who had won the parliamentary elections earlier that month, requested NATO to deploy a small force to operate as additional security for the observers and other agencies. NATO granted the request and the operation, which was named <em>Operation Amber Fox</em>, performed its mission until mid-December. It would prove necessary for the NATO forces to remain in Macedonia to minimise the risk of destabilisation in the country. The task of this new NATO operation would be to gradually transfer full responsibility to Macedonia’s police and military. It was named <em>Operation Allied Harmony</em> and commenced on16 December 2002, lasting for six months. <em>Operation Allied Harmony</em> was viewed as the end of the NATO presence in Macedonia and began with <em>Operation Essential Harvest/Task Force Harvest</em> on 27 August 2001, with the participation of a total of 4,800 soldiers. The EU took over responsibility in the form of the <em>Concordia</em> operation for the return of security responsibilities to Macedonian authorities. </span></p>"

The purpose of <em>Allied Harmony</em> was to follow the objectives of the resolution with regard to de-escalating the various conflicts, to prevent them from reigniting and spreading inside the country, including by working on an active basis alongside the Macedonian authorities.

                        "text": "<p><span>Iraq’s war with Iran in 1980 was very expensive to Iraq. After the end of the war, Iraq was billions in debt. Iraq’s dictator, Saddam Hussein, believed that neighbouring Kuwait had been illegally pumping oil from an oilfield that was in both Iraq and Kuwait and had been selling oil and making huge profits during the war. The allegedly illegal drilling had, according to Hussein, resulted in Iraq losing huge sums of money. He therefore wanted compensation from Kuwait for economic losses, which Kuwait refused to pay. Baghdad considered this to be an act of aggression and, on 2 August 1990, Iraq started what would eventually become known as the First Gulf War. At this time, Iraq had the fourth largest military in the world and conquered Kuwait very quickly. Kuwait was occupied in just two days and Iraqi tanks were then deployed to the border between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. If Hussein decided he wanted to continue the war and seize the Saudi Arabian oilfields, he would be in control of half of the world’s oil resources. Both Saudi Arabia and the USA were alarmed by this and had already strongly condemned the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, which was a fully sovereign state and the USA, Saudi Arabia and 25 other countries decided to intervene, with a mandate from the UN. The American-led coalition was deployed at the border of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and in the Persian Gulf off Kuwait. The mustering phase was named <em>Operation Desert Shield</em> and involved the assembly of an effective force that would be able to protect Saudi Arabia. This operation ran from 7 August 1990 to 17 January 1991. The coalition changed its strategy after January and transitioned to the offensive phase of the Gulf War, the ultimate goal being the liberation of Kuwait. This phase was named <em>Operation Desert Storm</em>. Denmark participated in both <em>Operation Desert Shield </em>and <em>Operation Desert Storm</em> with the corvette <em>Olfert Fischer</em>, which was deployed in <em>Operation Faraway</em>. The Danish corvette assisted in maintaining the UN trading embargo on Iraq and sailed reconnaissance and other missions in the Strait of Hormuz  The corvette’s status was that of “non-combatant”, which meant that <em>Olfert Fischer</em> was not permitted to engage in offensive action, only to defend itself against aggressors. The coalition finally liberated Kuwait on 28 February 1991. </span></p>"

This resolution condemned Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait and demanded that Saddam Hussein immediately withdrew his troops from Kuwait. When Hussein ignored the UN’s demands, the UN adopted Resolution 661 of 6 August 1990, which introduced economic sanctions against Iraq. In practical terms, this meant a trade blockade with a mandate to use armed force to maintain its integrity. <em>Olfert Fischer </em>was deployed under the resolution to enforce the objectives of this mandate. Maritime trade to Iraq was not the only trade that the UN wanted to limit. In UN Resolution 670 of 25 September 1990 it was decided that the embargo would also extend to air transport. This expanded embargo meant that aircraft carrying all other cargo than food, medicines or humanitarian aid would be denied entry to Iraqi air space. </span></p>\n<p><span>At the end of the war the UN adopted Resolution 687 of 3 April 1991, which formed the basis of the ceasefire between Iraq and Kuwait. One of the resolution’s requirements was that Iraq should destroy its stocks of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, as well as any missiles with ranges longer than 150 kilometres. Iraq was in addition required to accept verification by UN inspectors from the UN <em>Special Commission (UNSCOM)</em> and <em>the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)</em>.</span></p>"

The ship was authorised under the UN mandate to stop all incoming and outward bound maritime traffic for inspection and verification of their cargo and destinations. The Danish national instructions determined that the corvette’s mission was to ensure the implementation of sanctions against Iraq in accordance with resolutions 661 and 665.

One of these ships was the <em>Olfert Fischer</em>, which marked the first operation of a Danish warship outside Europe since the colonial era. The 92-strong crew was expanded to 100, with a doctor, chaplain, interpreter and various specialists and was not comprised of 16 officers, 11 non-commissioned officers, 54 male and 9 female marine constables, 8 conscripts, a chaplain and an interpreter. <br />The ship was slightly modified because it would face high levels of humidity and temperatures of up to 50 degrees Centigrade. The conditions that the Danes would be operating under in the Persian Gulf were somewhat different from usual. The corvette’s arms systems were also adjusted. Stinger ground-to-air missiles were fitted to supplement the ship’s normal <em>Sea Sparrow</em> defensive armament.<br />A decision was made in Norway on 31 August 1990 that coastguard vessel <em>Andenes</em> would be made available to <em>Olfert Fischer</em> as a supply ship, carrying spare parts and ammunition etc., with a Danish supply team serving on board. The two ships met on 19 October in the area of operation and were thus ready to take part in <em>Operation Faraway</em>. The Danish-Norwegian deployment operated in the Persian Gulf, with warships from seven other countries, including Canada, Argentina and Oman. </span></p>"

The mission was originally deployed west of the Strait of Hormuz, covering the area where the Gulf of Oman joins the Persian Gulf.

Belgium, France, West Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands met in Luxembourg in the town of Schengen, where an agreement was concluded to eliminate national border controls. Better know as “the Schengen Agreement”. This agreement meant that people from Schengen countries would be freely able to cross national borders, including when travelling by air and sea. Other countries joined the agreement later on, including Italy, Greece and Spain. Denmark signed up to Schengen in 1996 after an inter-governmental agreement between Denmark and the EU, with other countries joining during the 90s and 00s, as increased numbers of migrants and refugees were trying to get into the EU. Against this background, it was decided that border controls at the external borders of Schengen member states would be tightened. For this purpose, the EU set up the <em>Frontex</em> organisation, which became active in 2005. This is known under the same name in Danish, or as <em>Det Europæiske Agentur for Grænse- og Kystbevogtning</em> (European Border and Coast Guard Agency) and is responsible for coordinating operations and activities related to border controls. With the immigration crisis of 2015-2016 the EU’s external borders fell under immense pressure, including in Italy and Greece, it was decided that the <em>Frontex</em> mandate would be extended, becoming a full-scale border and coast guard agency. As well as issuing EU border security risk assessments, <em>Frontex</em> also published information about the potential for unlawful immigration and human trafficking to the involved EU countries. It also developed common training standards for border authorities, with a view to harmonising training within the Schengen nations. The operations in which <em>Frontex</em> was involved with coordination received further funding after the mandate was extended, allowing the operations to deal with larger areas. The Royal Danish Air Force and Danish police have contributed to border and coast guard operations in the form of surveillance/search operations for desperate boat refugees and migrants, the observation of smuggling operations and illegal fisheries. The Danish National Police has the overall responsibility for Danish <em>Frontex</em> participation.</span></p>\n<p><span>FRONTEX is comprised of various elements, each focusing on its own special areas: EURPOL for police deployments, EASO for asylum cases, EFCAC for fisheries and EMSAC for maritime safety.</span></p>"

One purpose of the organisation is to assist in the setting up of operations related to illegal immigration. This may involve border controls, surveillance of land and sea borders, the identification of forged documentation and the investigation of who may be responsible for the forgeries. <em>Frontex</em> is also tasked with the preparation of Schengen countries’ external border risk assessments with a view to revealing potential areas where there may be problems. When the EU began to experience the beginning of a major refugee crisis in 2015 with the arrival of 1.5 million illegal refugees, the EU pushed for an expansion of <em>Frontex </em>that would better enable the organisation to deal with the increased pressure. The augmentation of the organisation’s mandate was adopted in <em>COM 671 final,</em> which meant a tripling of the funding received by <em>Frontex</em> for the <em>Triton</em>, <em>Poseidon and Themis </em>missions, as well as increased funding to purchase equipment for small to medium-sized operations. Resources were also spent to further an increased partnership between <em>Frontex </em>and third world countries. The extended mandate meant 600 additional employees to accommodate the new workload.<br />European Commission <em>Council regulation </em>no. 2007 to establish the <em>Frontex</em> mandate was adopted on 26 October 2004, COM 671 final being adopted on 15 December 2015.</p>"

The war ended up lasting for eight years, costing both sides great human and financial expense. When the war ended in 1988, Iraq owed billions and Saddam Hussein believed that neighbouring Kuwait had been illegally pumping oil from an oilfield that was located in both countries and had sold the oil at an enormous profit while the war was going on. Hussein presented Kuwait with a demand for financial compensation, which was rejected. Iraq considered this rejection as an act of aggression and launched what would later be known as the First Gulf War on 2 August 1990. Denmark provided a humanitarian contribution during this war, sending doctors and medical teams to the Middle East and airborne ambulances that could fly the injured from the front line to military hospitals in Frankfurt and the Danish town of Holstebro. The choice of Holstebro was no coincidence. During the Cold War, Denmark had entered into an agreement with the USA that it would send reinforcements in the form of the 12th US Division that would be able to reinforce elements of the Danish-German corps in Slesvig-Holstein if an attack from the Eastern Bloc took place. The division would not bring its own hospital support but would be supported by an emergency hospital belonging to the US Air Force that had been set up during peacetime. This meant stockpiling medical equipment in Holstebro and making a number of modifications to the buildings of the Dragoons’ Barracks. When the USA, with Denmark as part of the coalition, entered the Gulf War, it therefore made good sense to activate the American emergency hospital in Holstebro with Danish personnel, including guards etc. The number of casualties incurred during the reconquest of Kuwait was, however, no higher than front-line field hospitals were able to cope with. The military hospital in Holstebro therefore ended up not being used.</p>"

The conference was led by the USA and the European Union (EU) and would serve as a framework for dialogues that would be able to bring peace to the Former Yugoslavia. The situation was critical. Croatia and Slovenia had left the Yugoslavian confederation. Croatia was home to a large Serb minority who opposed Croatian independence and who were actively supported by the Yugoslavian army, which led to armed engagements between Serbs and Croats. These conflicts then spread to Bosnia-Herzegovina. <em>ICFY</em> tried to manage these conflicts through dialogue between the involved parties, but to no avail. The failure to achieve results led to a UN decision to deploy a <em>United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)</em> in Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Macedonia and to deploy observers with the aid of the <em>European Union Monitoring Mission (ECMM</em>). <em>ICFY</em> also deployed its own observers. There were many reasons for these deployments, including the violent conduct of the Bosnian Serb military and the sanctions that had been deployed against Serbia, which meant that it was no longer permitted to bring materials such as fuel and armaments from Serbia to Bosnia-Herzegovina.  These sanctions required monitoring by neutral observers, which led NATO to request stricter surveillance of the border between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia by a third party in 1993. From 1994 to 1996, <em>ICFY</em> with observers from countries that included Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway, as well as France, Germany, Russia, the USA and the United Kingdom, was responsible for monitoring the border between Bosnia-Herzegovina and Serbia.

The first acts of war were when Croatia and Slovenia left the Yugoslavian confederation. There was fighting in Croatia, where a Serb minority did not wish to be part of Croatia. The European Community tried to stop the conflict, but to no avail. The UN then became involved and tried to end the fighting, introducing an embargo on the introduction of armaments and munitions to Yugoslavia in 1991. Negotiations were fruitless, so in 1992 the UN established the <em>United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)</em>, whose mission was to build peace and manage security in Yugoslavia. <em>UNPROFOR</em>was initially deployed in Croatia but it became quickly obvious that deployment in Croatia alone would not suffice. The force’s mandate was then extended to encompass Bosnia-Herzegovina. The situation there was complicated, with three ethnic groups: Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs, all of whom were fighting against each other. The prospect of a ceasefire looked distant. After an air campaign in autumn 1995, a peace treaty was finally signed in Paris on 14 December 1995 by the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia to end the 3½ year long war. This was called <em>the Dayton Peace Agreement (DPA)</em>. NATO was the organisation that would be responsible for maintaining law and order and ensuring that the objectives of the peace treaty were implemented in Bosnia-Herzegovina. <em>The Implementation Force (IFOR</em>) was set up to perform this role. Despite having only a single year’s mandate, this was a large-scale mission that involved 54,000 soldiers, a number which totalled 80,000 if supply troops in Croatia, Serbia and Hungary are also included. The force would initially concentrate on separating the two opposing factions (the national Bosnian forces and Bosnian Serb forces), the confiscation of arms and extensive patrols along the 1,400km “border” between the two combatants and in the vicinity of the demilitarised zones. In the second half of 1996, NATO’s <em>IFOR</em> would change into <em>The Stabilization Force (SFOR)</em>, which was set up on 20 December 1996. </span></p>"

This involved protecting the OSCE and EU observer mission (ECMM) and the work that was being done by humanitarian organisations including <em>The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR)</em>.  Danish units were very busy disarming the combatants near the northern town of Doboj in Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the Danish camp was located. It was important to gain control of the town, as this was part of the ethnic boundary between Muslims and Serbs. There was extensive focus on the prevention of conflict in the period leading up to the 14 September 1996 election of representatives to the House of Representatives for the Federation of Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Serb Republic, respectively. Due to the large presence of troops at the polling stations, high visibility and a long-term “diplomatic offensive” towards representatives of the local authorities, there were no problems.  Many resources were set aside during this entire period to provide humanitarian aid to the civilian population in and around Doboj. Other forms of humanitarian aid included support for the Danish Refugee Council and Save the Children, including aid in the reconstruction of schools and kindergartens.<br />Additional to these activities were the more routine duties that were performed on behalf of IFOR, as well as ongoing patrols, the collection and registration of weapons, dialogue with local authorities and surveillance etc.</span></p>"

The following covers only a few of the many factors that played a role. <br />After the Gulf War in 1991, the UN demanded among other things that Iraq destroy its weapons of mass destruction (chemical and biological weapons and nuclear weapons) as well as missiles with a range above 150 km (93 miles). Iraq was in addition required to accept verification by UN inspectors from the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tensions between Hussein and the UN/US persisted through the 1990s when Hussein refused to get rid of the weapons of mass destruction believed by the UN and the US to remain in his possession or to provide proof they had been eliminated. On 11 September 2001, two planes hijacked by Al-Qaeda flew into the World Trade Center, and a third plane hit the Pentagon. After the terrorist attack on America, George W. Bush initiated the war on terror under the name Operation Enduring Freedom. This war on terror turned out to have consequences also for Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Influential elements in the US believed that Hussein might have connections to Al-Qaeda and possibly could be sheltering terrorists. It was once again relevant to know whether Hussein still had weapons of mass destruction, and the Americans wanted to launch an investigation. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, and connections between Hussein and Al-Qaeda were not verified. The Iraqis made it difficult for the investigation teams to get access to information and to enter sites. As a result, many long discussions were held in the UN Security Council. To this day, opinions are divided as to these discussions. Similarly, opinions are divided as to whether there was a clear UN mandate to invade Iraq. There were arguments for and against an invasion, but nevertheless a coalition was formed for this purpose by the US. It was joined by many countries including Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The operation was named Operation Iraqi Freedom and was launched on 20 March 2003. During the invasion, Denmark contributed the submarine <em>Sælen,</em> the corvette <em>Olfert Fischer</em>, and a medical team. The invasion of Iraq was quick and effective, and Saddam Hussein’s government was ousted. The subsequent rebuilding of Iraq – in the midst of serious internal tensions among various segments of the population – turned out to be a protracted affair. Although the Iraq War ended in 2011, international forces are still present in the country today. That includes Danish soldiers. </p>"

Quite a few UN resolutions were made prior to the invasion. As an example, prior to the invasion, the UN had adopted Resolution 1441 of 8 November 2002 giving Iraq one last chance to meet its obligations to disarm and remove its weapons of mass destruction as it had been demanded by the UN since the end of the Gulf War. The most important part of Resolution 1441 was a demand that Iraq permit inspectors from the UN Monitoring and Verification Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to have unlimited freedom of movement and access to individuals for questioning at all times of the day or night. Although Saddam Hussein did not comply with the UN demands entirely, the work of the inspectors proceeded. However, when inspectors from UNMOVIC and IAEA were not granted unlimited and immediate access to some areas in Iraq, the US viewed it as a breach of Resolution 1441. Based on the absence of unconditional cooperation from Hussein, the US view was that the provisions in Resolution 1441 and in previous ones such as Resolutions 678 and 687 justified the use of military power against Iraq. In addition, the US view was that these resolutions could not prevent UN member nations from defending themselves against the threat from Iraq and could not – per Resolution 1441 – prevent them from using military power against Iraq. To this day, the justification for the invasion into Iraq is being debated.</p>"

When the corvette arrived at Rota in Spain a few days prior to the approval in Parliament, the crew received the order to proceed to the Persian Gulf in order to join Operation Iraqi Freedom. Olfert Fischer arrived at the naval base in Bahrain on 3 April after a very fast journey and returned to Denmark on 14 June 2003, having delivered about three months of service in the Persian Gulf. Like <em>Olfert Fischer,Sælen</em> had been a part of the <em>NATO Operation Active Endeavor</em> since the summer of 2002. The plan was for the submarine to return to Denmark in January 2003. That plan changed. The submarine was now ordered to head for the Persian Gulf. It arrived in Bahrain on 14 March and joined Operation Iraqi Freedom from 21 March to 5 June 2003. Upon the conclusion of the missions, it was transported back to Denmark from the base harbour in Bahrain aboard the cargo ship Grietje. Sælen returned to the naval base in Frederikshavn on 12 June 2003. The Danish medical team was deployed to Jordan to work at an American field hospital and was recalled on 16 April 2003.</p>"

The nation of Bosnia-Herzegovina seceded as well and was recognised as independent by EU member states and other countries in 1992. Armed clashes and warlike conditions were prevalent in a situation where Bosnian Muslims and Croats fought against each other and together against Bosnian Serbs. Unsuccessful attempts were made to negotiate ceasefires. The UN therefore in 1992 established United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) for the purpose of building peace and managing security in Yugoslavia. The force was deployed in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina and later in Macedonia as well. After three and a half years of conflict involving extensive loss of civilian lives, acts of ethnic cleansing, and expulsions, and especially after massive international pressure and an air campaign, at last a peace treaty was signed in Paris by the presidents of Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia on 14 December 1995. The accord was named the Dayton Peace Agreement (DPA) after the city in the US where the negotiations had taken place. In order to ensure compliance with the agreement, NATO in its capacity of operator took on the implementation in close collaboration with the UN. For this purpose, NATO in 1995 set up theImplementation Force (IFOR) as a replacement for UNPROFOR. IFOR operated in Bosnia-Herzegovina for a year, from 20 December 1995 to 20 December 1996, and was successful in destroying weapons and prevent further conflict in the country. Upon expiry of the mandate, there was still a requirement for a noticeable presence in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The replacement was set up under the name NATO Stabilisation Force (SFOR). This force was to continue undertaking tasks based on the peace agreement such as support for civilian peace efforts, separation of the warring parties, security for the political process, continued collection of heavy weapons for depot storage, surveillance of the weapons, and repatriation of refugees.

It included an armoured infantry battalion made up of staff officers, a staff company, an armoured infantry company, a tank squadron, and a logistics company. The Jaeger Corps provided reinforcements from 1996 to 2000. Parts of the professional units handling replenishment of supplies were situated in Hungary. In addition, Denmark contributed personnel and elements for the command structure of the Nordic-Polish Brigade and joint units and for NATO command structures. In total, the contribution to SFOR numbered about 750 personnel per team. Close collaboration took place in order to provide protection and support for personnel working in the civilian UN police force, for Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe(OSCE), and for the EU observer mission European Community Monitoring Mission (ECMM). All these missions had participation from Denmark. <br />SFOR was reduced from approximately 30,000 to 22,000 personnel and restructured in 2000. In this restructuring, the Nordic-Polish Brigade was eliminated in January 2000. Then, Denmark took the initiative to establish a battalion-sized Nordic-Polish battle group as a replacement. This unit would continue to be under the command of Multinational Division North led by the US. The Danish contribution to the new structure included a scout squadron, a tank squadron, and a national support element plus staff personnel and national elements in the joint supply corps. A few other types of units were set up, such as a joint military police unit and a joint unit handling civilian-military relations. The Danish contribution to the battle group in early 2000 amounted to about 400 soldiers and 20 personnel for the SFOR headquarters. As progress was seen in Bosnia-Herzegovina, reductions were made again in 2002 and 2003. The Nordic-Polish battle group was eliminated at the beginning of 2003 and replaced by a Portuguese-Polish battle group. In this new situation, the Danish contribution now included a tank squadron and support personnel. The unit was moved to the American base near the airport in Tuzla. It had light vehicles as well as tanks and thus was capable of undertaking several tasks, some of them as a reserve unit for the brigade led by the US in Tuzla. The Danish force now numbered 150 personnel.</p>\n<p>But in 2022 Denmarks returned to <em>EUFOR Althea</em> as a result of the Danish referendum on the lifting of the defence opt-out and as partners in the EU defence dimension.

There had been political tensions between the component states in Yugoslavia for years. Acts of war broke out when Croatia and Slovenia seceded from the federation. A significant minority of Serbs lived in the border area in southern Croatia, near Bosnia. They were opposed to Croatia being independent from the federated structure. Armed hostilities erupted between Croat Serbs, supported by the Yugoslav army, and the Croats. The European Community attempted without success to end the fighting. In parallel, the UN had become involved in the conflict and worked to establish a foundation for a solution and, in 1991, to stop the flow of arms and ammunition to the area.  This did not bear fruit, and the next objective was a potential UN mission to bring about a ceasefire. The UN in 1992 set up <em>United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR)</em>. Its task was to reinstate peace and provide security in Yugoslavia. </span><span>To begin with, <em>UNPROFOR</em> entered Croatia, but it soon became apparent that the effort would need a larger scope if there were to be any continued hope of peace in a Yugoslavia beset by civil war. Thus, <em>UNPROFOR</em> was expanded to include Bosnia and Herzegovina under the name <em>UNPROFOR II</em>. Challenges were piling up. There were clashes and incidents of hostility between Bosnian Muslims and Croats and between these two groups and the Bosnian Serbs who enjoyed considerable support in the Serbian state within Yugoslavia, not to mention that the humanitarian situation for civilians was dire. As the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina remained critical, Denmark (and the UN) in 1994 decided for the first time to use heavy weapons, in this case a tank squadron, in a peacekeeping mission. <em>UNPROFOR II</em> in Bosnia and Herzegovina was terminated in December 1995 when the Dayton Agreement between Bosnia, Croatia, and Serbia was signed on 14 December 1995 in Paris. Fighting had then gone on for three and a half years in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Annex 11 to the Dayton Agreement specified the parties’ agreement on deployment of an international civilian police force, <em> UN International Police Task Force (IPTF)</em>, to support enforcement of civil law in the republic.</span></p>\n<p><span> With a view to ensuring that the agreement was adhered to, the work was transferred to the NATO <em>Implementation Force </em>(<em>IFOR</em>) and the <em>UN Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina </em>(<em>UNMIBH</em>)<em>.</em> <em>UNMIBH</em> consisted of these elements: </span></p>\n<p><span>- <em>International Police Task Force</em> <em>(IPTF)</em> <br />- <em>Judicial System Assessment Programme</em> <em>(JSAP)</em> <br />- <em>Civil Affairs Unit <br />- Human Rights Office <br />- Public Affairs Office <br />- Administration</em></span></p>\n<p><span>These elements were intended to shore up the weak status of the rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina by assisting in restructuring the police force and educating it in the methods of maintaining law and order. <em>UNMIBH</em> in addition was tasked with monitoring the judicial system; there had been many reports of signs of judicial corruption. The work was distributed across Bosnia and Herzegovina at eight headquarters. The mission worked out of these headquarters until 2002 when it was terminated and replaced by the <em>European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina</em>(<em>EUPM/BiH</em>).</span></p>"

During the monitoring of the judiciary in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was discovered that the courts were not independent and that they were not treated as such by other institutions working with the courts. The courts were influenced by powerful politicians, and this had an impact on the judgements issued by the courts against the accused.

One rebel group gaining influence was the Taliban. Its roots were in the southern desert – one of the least hospitable areas in Afghanistan. The Taliban did away with most of the other warlords. With their strict orthodox policies, they countered the chaos that had erupted in the country after the war against the Soviet Union. The Taliban consolidated its power and influence in Afghanistan during the 1990s, culminating in 1996 when Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani gave up control of the capital city of Kabul. Now, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was a reality. With the Taliban in power, an extremist interpretation of Islamic religious texts was imposed in legislation that oppressed women and introduced corporal punishment. Early in the new millennium, the regime was suspected of having ties to the terrorist network Al-Qaeda after the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001. In response to the terrorist attack, a coalition led by the US invaded Afghanistan and ousted the Taliban regime. However, notwithstanding that the Taliban movement was officially ousted, it had strong popular support and continued operations as a guerrilla group actively attempting to fight the coalition and the democratically elected government. To day the Taliban has retained power in Afghanistan. One of the instruments used to build up the country before 2021 was the <em>NATO Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan (RS)</em>. It was established in 2015 as a successor to the earlier NATO mission International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). The purpose and mission for RS was to provide training, guidance, and support for Afghan security forces and military institutions. The mission ended in 2021.</p>"

One of the rebel groups gaining influence was the Taliban. It was based in the southern part of the country, one of the least hospitable areas in Afghanistan. The Taliban did away with some other warlords. With its strict orthodox policies, it countered the chaos that had erupted in the country after the war. The Taliban consolidated its power and influence in Afghanistan during the 1990s, culminating in 1996 when Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani gave up control of the capital city of Kabul. Now, the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan was a reality. An extremist interpretation of Islam was now imposed in legislation that oppressed women and introduced corporal punishment. After the terrorist attack on the U.S. on 11 September 2001, the Taliban regime was suspected of having ties to the terrorist Al-Qaeda network. In response to the terrorist attack, a coalition led by the U.S. invaded Afghanistan and ousted the Taliban regime. However, notwithstanding that the Taliban movement was officially ousted, it had strong popular support and continued operations as a guerilla group actively attempting to fight the coalition and the democratically elected Afghan government. To day, the Taliban had retained power in Afghanistan. In an effort to help, the UN in 2003 on request from the Afghan government set up <em>United Nations Assistance</em> <em>Mission in Afghanistan </em>(<em>UNAMA</em>). Since then, the <em>UNAMA</em> mission has worked to build peace in the country internally and to build peace between Afghanistan and its neighbouring countries through the use of advisers rather than combat forces.</p>"

The decision to launch UNAMA was based on the UN Secretary-General’s report S/278 dated 18 March 2002 and on the “Agreement on Provisional Arrangements in Afghanistan Pending the Re-establishment of Permanent Government Institutions” signed in Bonn on 5 December 2001 (the Bonn Agreement).<br /></span>As an aid in setting up a transitional government, it fell to <em>UNAMA</em> to coordinate and lead the international civilian effort in Afghanistan. Hence it was primarily a political mission. <br />The mandate was provided in UN Resolution 1401 of 27 March 2002. It has since then been updated every year, most recently in  September 2021,until fall 2022.<br />It was recognised immediately that Afghanistan needed international aid in developing, training, and advising a new Afghan police force. Germany had previously provided such aid, and therefore a bilateral agreement was made between Afghanistan and Germany that the latter would manage overall development and training along with other countries.</p>"

The following covers only a few of the many factors that played a role.</span></p>\n<p>After the Gulf War in 1991, the UN demanded that Iraq destroy its weapons of mass destruction and missiles with a range above 150 kilometres (93 miles). Iraq was in addition required to accept verification of the destruction by UN inspectors from the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Tensions between Hussein and the UN/US persisted through the 1990s when Hussein refused to get rid of the weapons of mass destruction believed by the UN and the US to remain in his possession or to provide proof they had been eliminated. On 11 September 2001, two planes hijacked by Al-Qaeda flew into the World Trade Center, and a third plane hit the Pentagon. After this terrorist attack, the U.S. initiated the war on terror under the name <em>Operation Enduring Freedom</em>. This war on terror turned out to have consequences also for Iraq and Saddam Hussein. Influential elements in the U.S. believed that Hussein might have connections to Al-Qaeda and possibly could be sheltering terrorists. It was once again relevant to know whether Hussein still had weapons of mass destruction, and the Americans wanted to launch an investigation. No weapons of mass destruction were found in Iraq, and connections between Hussein and Al-Qaeda were not verified. The Iraqis made it difficult for the investigation teams to get access to information and to enter sites; this did not help matters. As a result, many long discussions were held in the UN Security Council. Opinions are still divided as to these discussions. Similarly, opinions are divided as to whether there was a clear UN mandate to invade Iraq. There were many arguments for and against an invasion, but nevertheless a coalition was formed for this purpose by the U.S. It was joined by many countries including Denmark, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The coalition invaded Iraq and toppled Hussein. Then, the new Iraqi government needed help to manage the now fragile country. One of the missions set up to help the new government was <em>The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq </em>(<em>UNAMI</em>). This mission was set up in 2003 by the UN Security Council on request from the Iraqi government. The objective of the mission was to support and improve democratic functions in Iraq and to help coordinate humanitarian initiatives offered to Iraq from the UN and other countries. <em>UNAMI </em>is still active in Iraq. <br /><br /></p>"

Protracted hostilities forced President Ali Abdullah Saleh to resign after many years in his post. Per a framework agreement negotiated by Arab Gulf nations, Saudi Arabia in the lead, Saleh resigned, and Vice President Abd Rabbuh Mansour Hadi succeeded him. The plan was to hold elections for president three months later and initiate a national dialogue on the transition to a democratic system and on the drafting of a new constitution.<br />During that election in February 2012, Hadi was ratified as president – with no other candidates on the ballot. The election was boycotted by several groups, including the Houthi movement from the northern part of Yemen. Saleh had attempted to crush this movement several times during his last decade as president.<br />The national dialogue took place from March 2013 to January 2014. It enjoyed broad support among the people of Yemen and in the international community. However, not everyone was pleased with the result and with the fact that Hadi remained in the post as president, and a new federated system had several population groups feeling unfairly treated. When economic reforms sparked protests, the Houthis in September 2014 took advantage of the unrest, with support from ex-president Saleh, to take control of most of the country.  Hadi was held in house arrest for several months but managed to escape to Aden. Here he received support from several Arab states, primarily Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and these states took an active role in the conflict in March 2015.</span></p>\n<p><span>This civil war quickly became a massive humanitarian crisis. About 20 million out of the population of 28 million depended on aid organisations to survive. Approximately 80% of all imports, commercial as well as humanitarian, entered Yemen through the port city of Hudaydah. On the pretext that the port was being used for smuggling weapons, the Saudi-led coalition several times blocked the port and inspected all incoming ships. Arguing that it was time to end arms smuggling once and for all, the coalition and Hadi’s forces mounted an offensive against the city during the summer of 2018.<br /></span></p>"

Finally, the parties were persuaded to meet in Rimbo north of Stockholm, Sweden, from 6 to 13 December 2018. It was not expected, but a ceasefire in and around Hudaydah was indeed negotiated as a framework agreement for withdrawal by both parties and for a series of trust-building mechanisms to facilitate renewed meetings in short order to discuss a ceasefire for the entire country.<br /></span>In support of the ceasefire and the peace process, the UN Security Council on 21 December 2018 unanimously approved Resolution 2451.

Two officers from the Emergency Management Agency were assigned the mission of finding a depot for the food and were sent to St. Petersburg, where they collaborated with the city council and the Danish General Consul. The consignment arrived by ship in St. Petersburg on 28 January and distribution could commence from various premises across the city.

Large rural areas were cut off from the rest of the world. Energy supply lines were also out of action, which made it difficult to pump water away from low-lying areas. Industry and agricultural production were also badly affected.<br />On 18 July 1997, the Emergency Management Agency was contacted by the Polish government via <em>United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs (UNDHA)</em>, requesting aid that was mostly needed in the south-west of Poland. The Danish Embassy in Warsaw had already contacted the Polish government to offer Danish aid before the official request was received from the Polish government.<br />There were problems once again in 2010.

All personnel were based in Durres.<br />The 911 project in Albania involved the delivery of nine Mercedes Benz 911 lorries to Ankona in Italy, where they were transferred to Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and DanChurchAid (DCA). The 14 personnel came from the Emergency Management Agency and local authority volunteers.<br />The emergency team would provide assistance to the DCA's project in Skopje, Macedonia in the performance of administrative and practical tasks. The team participated in the task of accommodating approximately 300,000 refugees in tent camps in the north of Macedonia. The most important tasks were the reception and housing of refugees and providing them with food. One major task was the coordination of food supplies that were sent to the camps by transport aircraft, ship and lorry. The Danish personnel were three officers and six NCOs who were stationed in Skopje.<br />The task of the buildings team was to assess the suitability of public and private buildings for use as temporary housing for refugees in Albania. Particular attention was paid to housing during the winter. The buildings team was comprised of five people from construction backgrounds and operated from the base in Durrès.<br />The mission of the bus project (also known as “the joint project”) that was operated by the Emergency Management Agency and DCA was to move approx. 40,000 refugees from Albania to Kosovo, using 40 buses. There were approx. 160 personnel from DCA, the Emergency Management Agency and civilians who had been recruited locally. The Emergency Management Agency provided command functions, convoy commanders and two mechanics. It also provided a Camp Manager and five Support Staff for camp administration and operation in Kukes, where the personnel were quartered.<br />Airfield Handling at Tirana Airport, performing practical tasks such as aircraft loading and unloading. The contribution was comprised of 12 people, seven of whom were from the Emergency Management Agency and five from the British Emergency Management Group/Department For International Development (ELM/DFID), a partnership that had been established from the International Humanitarian Partnership (IHP).<br />The leasing of vehicles involved the transportation of 19 “911” lorries to Albania, where they were transferred to various humanitarian organisations until December 1999.

Here, Denmark was able to offer aid in the form of hospital capacity and the supply of drinking water. Support was also provided to the international organisations in the form of qualified personnel who performed coordination tasks between the inserted aid organisations and the local authorities.<br />The mobile hospital's operating theatre performed a total of 385 operations. The casualty section treated 5,019 injuries of varying seriousness. Local and international medical personnel were associated with the hospital, in addition to the Danish personnel. The hospital mainly treated orthopaedic patients. Other types of injuries were transferred or referred to other treatment facilities in the area. The staff off the mobile hospital also contributed to the reopening of the local hospital in Banda Aceh.<br />After installation and the training of local personnel, the water purification equipment was operated by Danish personnel for a few days. It was then transferred to the local authorities as a donation from the Danish state. Each water purification module had a capacity of approx. 800 litres of drinking water an hour.<br />The experts were posted to UN/OCHA, who had set up coordination facilities in Banda Aceh, Colombo, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. <br />When winding down the Danish contribution in Banda Aceh and Sri Lanka, parts of the materials were transferred to the local and regional authorities as a gift from the Danish state.<br />The scale of the disaster in Indonesia after the Tsunami was immense. The death toll was 131,000 people, approximately 37,000 people were missing, over 500,000 people were made homeless and 117,000 houses were destroyed or badly damaged.</p>"

Psychologists were also stationed to help the other personnel to process what they experienced.<br />An approximate total of 180 Danish police officers and other police personnel were sent to the region.<br />The mission of the Emergency Management Agency was to prevent the outbreak of epidemics in the affected areas by setting up drinking water supplies as soon as possible. Each water purification module had a capacity of approx. 800 litres of drinking water an hour. The total output was therefore approx. 27,000 litres an hour.<br />The 39 water purification systems were set up at five different locations on the south and east coast, as advised by the Sri Lankan authorities. The systems were operated for the first few days by the Danish experts as they trained local personnel in the operation and maintenance of the systems. The materials were then transferred to the local authorities as a donation from the Danish state. </p>"

In recent years, we have to look back to 1978 during the Lebanese civil war, in which the Hezbollah movement (a political party and heavily armed militia) played a major role. When the 1990 peace was declared, Hezbollah was the only involved party that did not disarm. The southern part of the country was still under Israeli occupation at this time and Hezbollah was seen by the Lebanese as the strongest element of the resistance movement. Despite the fact that Israel withdrew from Lebanon in the year 2000, there have been numerous occasions where Hezbollah and Israel were involved in armed combat.<br />On the morning of 12 July 2006, Hezbollah fired rockets over the border and attacked an Israeli convoy, kidnapping two soldiers for barter in hostage exchanges. This led to a major conflict between Israeli military and Hezbollah militia on Lebanese territory, initially in the form of bomb and rocket attacks across the border and eventually, during the summer, an actual invasion in the south of the Lebanon involving Israeli troops and tanks. Even though the Israeli government stated on various occasions that it considered itself only to be at war with Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon and not with the Lebanese State, government buildings and many civilian areas were badly hit. Hezbollah rockets did not differentiate between military and civilian targets inside Israel, or between Israelis and civilians from other countries.<br />On 15 July 2006, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark summoned members of the International Operations Staff (IOS) to an information meeting about the situation for Danish citizens in Lebanon.</p>"

Approximately 1 million people were made homeless. Most public and private sector buildings were destroyed, as was the country’s infrastructure which also broke down.

Its epicentre was out at sea, 130 km (80 miles) to the east of Honshu island in the Miyagi province. The coast was hit by waves of up to 10 m (33 ft), which caused extensive devastation and resulted in the loss of many lives and caused many injuries. The authorities estimated in the days immediately after the disaster that approximately 2,000 people had been killed and 5,000 had been injured.<br />The devastation on the coastline meant that 380,000 people had to be evacuated. A further 210,000 people were evacuated from the area surrounding the Fukushima atomic power station, which had been seriously damaged by the tsunami.<br />On 12 March, there was an explosion in reactor 1, which destroyed the building around the reactor itself. On 13 March, there was another explosion, this time in reactor 3. At this point, the Japanese government asked for international aid via the international organisations.</p>"

Because of the civil war and the flow of refugees it created, the task of planting crops was only carried out to a lesser degree, which meant that there was a serious threat of future famine. It was estimated that approximately seven million people would be affected by food shortages and that approximately 2.2 million would be in actual life-threatening situation.<br />International aid organisations’ stockpiles of food, fuel, generators, medicines, vehicles etc. were fully or partly commandeered by local authorities, paramilitary groups and the military.

The camp was put together and delivered by MSB (Myndigheten för Samhällsskydd och Beredskap). When requested by MSB, Danish personnel participated in the installation and start-up operations of the camp facilities.<br />By midsummer 2012, the refugee situation in Southern Sudan and, notably in the Upper Nile State and Mabam Country provinces, was so bad that the UN had no qualified overview of the situation. Because of this, there was a desire to construct a number of smaller district offices with accommodation facilities for the regular staff. In June 2012, the <em>UNHCR</em> in Geneva contacted the IHP countries to ask for assistance. To bring about the best possible basis for providing aid to the UN organisations, a reconnaissance mission to Southern Sudan was carried out by emergency aid experts from Denmark, Norway and Finland. <br />Based on the long time perspective for the UN’s presence in Southern Sudan and the fact that climate would vary during the course of the year, the tent facilities were replaced by prefabricated housing with air conditioning. The entire project was implemented under <em>IHP</em> auspices, with Danish leadership. During the summer of 2014, camp facilities were set up in Gumuruk, Dorein, Labrab and Pibor. After being set up and commissioned, the camps were transferred to <em>UNHCR (UN High Commissioner for Refugees) and IOM (International Organization for Migration)</em>.<br />In October 2013, <em>WFP</em> made a request to the Emergency Management Agency for a Danish emergency management expert to support the organisation’s work in Southern Sudan. This request was granted for a period of six weeks.<br /></span><span class=\"Y2IQFc\">The contribution in 2020 was to set up three relief camps in Sudan. The camps were to support the work of receiving refugees from Ethiopia. Due to the war in the Tigray region, the situation was critical and the need to scale up emergency relief efforts was acute.</span></p>"

Haiyan was a category five typhoon, with winds of up to 315 km/h (196 miles/h) and an average wind speed of 160 km/h (99 miles/h). The typhoon’s passage caused extensive damage on the islands of Samar, Leyte, Cebu and Ileilo. Experts assessed that the city of Tacloban on the island of Leyte was 90% destroyed. <br />Generally, the affected islands had difficulty obtaining clean drinking water, food, shelter, electricity and access to telephone and Internet connections. Another issue was that the transportation of aid equipment and emergency aid to the islands’ populations was hindered by a shattered infrastructure.<br />4.5 million people were affected by the typhoon. Over 300,000 people were living in primitive evacuation centres. The authorities anticipated that up to 10,000 people had perished.<br />On 9 November, the Filipino government requested the international community for aid in dealing with the consequences of the typhoon’s passage through the area and for assistance in the coordination of national and international missions.</span></p>"

Personnel support was also deployed to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' citizens’ advice service, a nurse to support UNOCHA and a kitchen manager to run the UN camp kitchen.<br /><em>WFP</em> needed to renovate and upgrade their facilities in Tacloban and Guiuan with a view to having the capacity to cope with missions in the vicinity of evacuees in the camps. Under <em>IHP (International Humanitarian Partnership)</em> auspices, Denmark sent a technical support team with a broad craftsmanship background and plenty of familiarity with the camp’s facilities. The team worked in Tacloban from the beginning of December 2013 to the end of February 2014.<br />The UN organisations on the Philippines needed to renovate and extend their facilities to better enable the organisations to cope with their many extensive missions. The <em>IHP</em> member states coordinated the renovation and construction of the required facilities in partnership with local advisers and contractors. The missions were led by a Danish team.<br />Under IHP auspices, and to support <em>UNOCHA</em>’s work towards the coordination of national and international aid in the disaster area, two OSOCCs were set up with three associated Base Camp Light and support modules of various types. The mission was performed using personnel and materials from the IHP member states. One OSOCC configuration was supplied by Denmark, Finland and Luxembourg. The second was supplied by Sweden, Norway and Estonia.<br />An emergency call-out team under the auspices of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was sent to support the Danish Consulate on the Philippines. The team was comprised of personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the National Police and the Emergency Management Agency.<br />Denmark sent a nurse to support UN personnel in the area where the mission was being carried out. The nurse’s first task was to evaluate local treatment facilities and capacity with a view to the treatment of UN personnel in the area. Another task was the preparation of an ”in case of emergency” plan for these personnel. The nurse was also responsible for the UN’s medical equipment and the purchasing/acquisition of necessary medicines. A quality assessment was then performed to evaluate the capacity at nearby hospitals in the event that UN personnel were seriously injured. The mission lasted for 42 days.<br />A Danish cook was posted to the UN camp in Tacloban for a period of six weeks.</span></p>"

From 1960 until the present day, there have been numerous coups d'etat. CAR’s power base has always depended on military backing. Neighbouring Libya and Chad have on various occasions been involved in these conflicts to some extent.<br />In February 2014, the UN reported that 900,000 people in the country had taken flight and that half of the country’s 4.6 million inhabitants were in urgent need of humanitarian aid in the form of food and medical support. There was also a flow of refugees from neighbouring countries because of a long period of drought and internal power struggles between rival groups. Increased international aid was therefore required from the international aid organisations.<br />In May 2014, the UN requested aid from the <em>IHP (International Humanitarian Partnership</em>) member states in the renovation and expansion of the UN’s facilities in the Central African Republic (CAR).</span></p>\n<p><span>In addition a specific UN mission was established - <em>UN Integrated Peacebuilding Office in the Central African Republic (BINUCA).</em></span></p>"

The disease quickly spread from Guinea, where the first cases were diagnosed in March 2014, to neighbouring Liberia, Sierra Leone, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were particularly badly affected by the epidemic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that, from the beginning of March 2014 to April 2016, a total of 28,616 people had been infected in the three main countries. Of these, 11,310 died. The disease also claimed victims among healthcare personnel. According to Médecins Sans Frontières, 500 of the dead were health professionals. The deaths of these valuable professionals placed even greater pressure on the already inadequate healthcare services in the affected countries. On 8 August 2014, the WHO classified the Ebola outbreak as an international public health emergency situation. That same month the organisation requested aid from the international community.<br />Liberia was the worst hit of the countries affected by Ebola, with over 10,672 infected and 4,800 dead from a population of 4.3 million. The first case of Ebola was discovered on 30 March 2014 in Lofa County, which borders Sierra Leone and Guinea. The disease spread quickly from this base. On 23 August, all parts of Liberia were hit by Ebola. When transmission of the disease peaked in August and September 2014, the WHO was reporting between 300 to 400 new cases every week. <br />When Ebola appeared, Liberian society was still recovering from a 14-year civil war that had ended in 2003. The civil war had left the country’s healthcare service in ruins. The numerous deaths among healthcare personnel brought the already-fragile health service to its knees. Multiple hospitals closed because of personnel fatalities. Other hospitals had no option but to turn away sick patients. Without the ability to hospitalise those who were infected, the disease began to spread at a rapid pace. <br />After 10 months, Liberia’s government, with help from the international community, was able to beat the outbreak. By mid-January 2015, Ebola was only present in two regions of the country. During the spring of 2015, only very few new cases were diagnosed and, on 9 May 2015, Liberia was the last country that the WHO was able to declare Ebola-free, with no new cases. Isolated new cases appeared up to 2016, but these were properly treated and the disease did not spread.</span></p>"

The mission in Western Africa involved a degree of risk. Some of the employees were suspected of having been infected by the lethal Ebola virus. Luckily, this turned out not to be the case, but the suspicion alone was very stressful to those who were suspected of being infected and to their families and colleagues.</span></p>"

                        "text": "<p><span>During the spring of 2014, the biggest Ebola epidemic in history broke out in Western Africa. The disease quickly spread from Guinea, where the first cases were diagnosed in March 2014, to neighbouring Liberia, Sierra Leone, Mali, Nigeria and Senegal. Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone were particularly badly affected by the epidemic. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reported that, from the beginning of March 2014 to April 2016, a total of 28,616 people had been infected in the three main countries. Of these, 11,310 died. The disease also claimed victims among healthcare personnel. According to Médecins Sans Frontières, 500 of the dead were health professionals. The deaths of these valuable professionals placed even greater pressure on the already inadequate healthcare services in the affected countries. On 8 August 2014, the WHO classified the Ebola outbreak as an international public health emergency situation. That same month the organisation requested aid from the international community.<br />The first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone was diagnosed in May 2014. The disease then spread very quickly. On 30 July, Sierra Leone’s government declared a state of emergency and deployed the army to enforce a quarantine that prohibited residents of areas with high infection rates from leaving the quarantined areas. Despite these government measures, the disease continued to spread and in October 2014, Ebola cases had been diagnosed in every region of Sierra Leone.<br />The Ebola epidemic was a bigger problem than Sierra Leone’s already-pressed healthcare system was able to deal with. There were too few beds, doctors and nurses to treat Ebola patients and there was also a shortage of equipment to protect healthcare personnel from themselves being infected.<br />The number of new infections continued to increase until the end of January 2015, when the World Health Organisation (WHO) reported a fall in the number of new infections for the first time since the outbreak of the epidemic. After 42 days with no new cases of infection, the WHO, on 7 November 2015, announced that the disease was no longer spreading in Sierra Leone. A few new cases were diagnosed leading up to the summer of 2016.<br />The Ebola epidemic had caused a high death toll in Sierra Leone. At the end of 2015, the government announced that the country, with its 6.2 million inhabitants, had had over 9.000 cases of Ebola. According to the BBC, 3,955 people had perished. The epidemic also interrupted essential food production and trade, thus creating a related humanitarian crisis for a large number of families, particularly in rural areas.</span></p>"

After a request from the Iraqi government, a new coalition was formed to fight ISIL. Participants included the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Jordan, Morocco, and Denmark. Its official launch was in October under the name <em>Operation Inherent Resolve.</em> The goal was not to deploy a force to fight ISIL on the ground, but to defeat them from the air, while sending a number of individuals to Iraq to advise and train its army to fight against ISIL. Some countries also sent forces to Iraq to combat ISIL more directly.<br />On 9 December 2017, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi declared that the Islamic State was definitively defeated in Iraq and that all its territory had been retaken. Remnants of ISIL, however, have still been able to carry out isolated terrorist attacks, for example with suicide bombs in Baghdad in early 2018.</p>\n<p>NATO has been involved for a number of years in the implementation of training activities and measures to increase capacity in Iraq that would allow the country to be better able to perform these tasks.

This set out the framework for an international military force that would support the provisional government. The UN’s intent for this <em>International Security Assistance Force </em>(<em>ISAF</em>) was to put together a large scale force with a mandate in international law, that would be able to guarantee security in Kabul and its surrounding area while Afghan military and police forces were being built.</p>\n<p><em>ISAF</em> command would initially rotate every six months among the nations that were participating on a voluntary basis.

Under UN supervision, the clan leaders agreed in December 2001 that a provisional government would be set up, led by Hamid Karzai, and that it would continue to govern until a permanent democratically-elected solution could be implemented.</p>\n<p>The Bonn agreement included a section about the creation of an international security force that would train Afghanistan’s own security forces and help to rebuild public institutions.<br />Soon after the conference in Bonn, on 20 December 2001, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1386. This set out the framework for an international military force that would support the provisional government. The UN’s intent for this <em>International Security Assistance Force </em>(<em>ISAF</em>) was to put together a large scale force with a mandate in international law, that would be able to guarantee security in Kabul and its surrounding area while Afghan military and police forces were being built.</p>\n<p><em>ISAF</em> command would initially rotate every six months among the nations that were participating on a voluntary basis. This system turned out to be inefficient, however, so <em>ISAF</em> was assigned to NATO command in August 2003 after being invited by the UN and the Afghan government.</p>"

Because Germany had only issued a rather narrow mandate to its contingent, limiting the soldiers’ ability to carry out operations and patrols, all patrols that were not in the immediate vicinity of the base were performed by the Danish troops. The Danish contribution was thus responsible for 27 out of 28 districts in Badakhshan and ran over half of all patrols in the province.<br />In addition to the German and Danish contributions, 40 Czechs also served in the PRT. Their role was to provide security and inspections in the camp and the nearby landing strip, as well as night patrols of the immediate vicinity, as the German contingent was not permitted to leave the camp at this time.</p>\n<p>The Danish troops performed civil-military collaboration (CIMIC) operations as part of the Danish strategy for Afghanistan. The force collaborated with local civilian authorities on smaller projects to generate a positive presence in the area. The task of the CIMIC projects was not to rebuild Afghanistan, but to create conditions that were conducive towards allowing this to happen. The projects were intended to generate good will and security among the local population that would benefit the patrolling forces. In practice, this was achieved by providing materials to local schools (books, small desks and chairs etc) or by providing provisions for use by the local population during the winter. These projects also supported the mission of the German PRT by stabilising and rebuilding the area.<br />During the period in which the Danish troops were assigned to the PRT in Feyzabad, the Afghan population saw major gains as a country. For example, in 2008 the region was the area of Afghanistan with the highest rate of schooling, with almost equal numbers of girls and boys attending schools. This was in sharp contrast to the Taliban era, during which neither girls nor boys could even hope for normal schooling.</p>"

The main specialisation of the Danish troops was logistics and IT. The troops from Squadron 680 were deployed until 15 February 2006.<br />When units are deployed by the Royal Danish Air Force, it is with the participation of communications specialists from 615 Combat Communication Squadron (CIS), the Royal Danish Air Force’s equivalent to the Danish Army’s DCM company (see: <em>ISAF - Kabul</em>). These specialists are responsible to set up and maintain military and communication links for the soldiers to call back home. The duties of the eight-strong CIS Enabling Team were to produce the best possible quarters for the Danish troops that arrived in Kabul in May 2005.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong>In August 2005, two RAC-radar units and support personnel (approx. 4 people) were deployed to Kabul’s international airport from Air Control Wing Karup under the name “Danish Air Force Radar International System” (DARIS). Here, the Danish radar units would assist flight controllers in the airport’s control tower by providing radar images and air traffic information. DARIS thus made it possible to increase air traffic from 200 take-offs and landings each day in 2005 to over 400 in 2009. The Danish radar contribution therefore provided critical support for civilian and military cargo and personnel transport to and from Afghanistan.<br />DARIS was replaced by a US-financed radar project in November 2009.<br />With DARIS, the Royal Danish Air Force deployed a C-130J Hercules transport aircraft and an approx. 60-strong loading and unloading team (Air Movement and Control Element) to Kabul international airport in August 2005. Here, the Danish transport contribution would fly supplies all over Afghanistan to support the <em>ISAF</em> mission. The aircraft were deployed three times and recalled at the end of January 2006. On various occasions later on, Denmark deployed transport aircraft contributions in the form of C-130J aircraft and their support groups for the entire duration of <em>ISAF</em>, including to Kabul in 2010 and to the airfield in Kandahar in 2012.</p>\n<p>July 2008 saw the deployment of four Fennec helicopters and support crew to Afghanistan to support Danish and British troops in the Helmand province. The helicopters were partially armoured before the mission, allowing them to fly over the dangerous Helmand province. Here, the Danish helicopters would assist ground troop patrols by acting as their eyes from above, including reconnoitring targets<span>  </span>and gathering intelligence. These helicopters were unarmed and operated, inter alia, as “top-cover”, supporting ground troops by reporting anything suspicious ahead on routes that were often high-risk. The helicopter detachment operated until November 2008 and flew 650 hours without being hit by the Taliban.</p>\n<p>A 45-strong contribution from Combat Support Wing was deployed to Kandahar Air Field in 2007 as the command of the air base was transferred from the USA to NATO. The unit would be responsible for securing and monitoring fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters at the air base, as well as extending it. The unit would also service cargo aircraft arriving at Kandahar Air Field. The contribution was recalled at the end of June 2008. Another 9 people were also deployed as part of the air base’s staff. The staff contribution was recalled in August 2009. During the 2007-2008 period, multi-role dogs and their handlers were deployed from Combat Support Wing Karup to patrol the base.</p>"

A new smaller-scale NATO mission was set up in its place in 2015, called <em>Resolute Support Mission. </em>Its purpose was to continue the training and provision of advice to the Afghan security forces and national institutions. The new mission assisted the Afghans as they fought to defeat Taliban rebels etc. but did not playd an active role in the engagements.

                        "text": "<p>In January 2009, five soldiers from the Royal Danish Air Force CIS Enabling Team and five soldiers from Construction Team were deployed to Afghanistan to prepare facilities for a subsequent Danish <em>Operational Mentoring and Liaison Team (OMLT).</em> This would be based at Camp Shorabak near Camp Bastion in the Helmand Province.<span>  </span>An OMLT was a team of advisers whose role was to train various Afghan units and was thus one of the capacity-building projects of the <em>ISAF</em> mission.<br />The first team arrived at Camp Shorabak at the end of January 2009. Team 1 was 12-strong, ten of whom were mentors and two were assistants. While the Royal Danish Air Force in the form of its Combat Support Wing was responsible for the OMLT contribution, this was actually a cross-service mission, the teams being composed of personnel from the entire Danish military. The mission of the Danish OMLT mentors was to support and train designated key individuals such as heads of garrison, staff commanders, logistics commanders, clinic managers and heads of maintenance.<br />A total of seven Royal Danish Air Force teams were deployed in an OMLT capacity up to February 2012, after which responsibility for the OMLT mission was assigned to the army. In May 2012 the mission was to advice Camp Shorabak commanders, which was being wound down by <em>ISAF</em>.<span>  </span></p>\n<p>Three specially-trained multi-role dogs and their handlers were deployed from Combat Support Wing Karup in 2009. The dogs were trained to track and trace a number of different types of explosives. Because the use of multi-role dogs for this purpose had produced good results, these were deployed on multiple occasions, including with Danish special forces in Task Force 7 in 2013-14.<br />Four members of the Royal Danish Air Force Security Force (SECFOR) were sent to Mazar-e Sharif in December 2011. Their mission was to secure the sector where local Afghans were constructing facilities for use in the forthcoming Danish Mobile Air Control Centre (MACC) radar unit. The four SECFOR soldiers were recalled in January 2012.</p>\n<p>The mobile MACC radar unit from Air Control Wing Karup arrived at Mazar-e Sharif in February 2012.<span>  </span>The radar unit was comprised of an AN-TPS-77 long-range mobile radar and a smaller RAC-3D warning radar that was set up in Kunduz north-east of Mazar-e Sharif.Elements of the contribution were also deployed to Meymaneh in north-western Afghanistan. The deployment was part of the Helmand plan and involved 210 troops over the entire period, the bulk being stationed at Camp Marmal in Mazar-e Sharif. 42 Danish soldiers were stationed at Mazar-e Sharif, with three more at the German base in Kunduz, rotating every third month. The mission of the radar contribution was to monitor air traffic over north-western Afghanistan and to coordinate incoming and outward-bound flights in the region to minimise in-air accidents and generally increase air safety. The radar unit was deployed until May 2013.<br />In 2012 the Royal Danish Air Force deployed a 26-strong staff contribution to support operations at Afghanistan’s strategic airfields. These troops were split between Kabul’s International Airport (KAIA) and Kandahar Airfield (KAF). The six soldiers who were deployed to KAIA were part of the staff, supporting the operation of the military wing of the airport in partnership with French troops. The KAF contribution was comprised of staff for general airfield operations, Security Force (who were responsible for security) and Aerial Port Service, who were involved with base logistics support.<span>  </span>The contribution was recalled at the end of 2014.</p>\n<p>In addition the Air Transport Wing many times deployed C-130J to Afghanistan in support of ISAF. They flew out of Kabul Airport and Kandahar Airfield with cargo and personel - and was essetiel in the national rotation of forces.</p>\n<p>Three EH101 Merlin rescue and transport helicopters were deployed in July 2014 in a tactical troop transport role. They and their support personnel were deployed to the Camp Marmal base near Mazar-e Sharif in northern Afghanistan. The 76-strong team of personnel was comprised of aircrew, aircraft maintenance ground crew, logistics and other support personnel and was under the command of the German-led regional command in Mazar-e Sharif. The mission of the transport helicopter contribution was to be in a state of readiness to evacuate casualties, to rescue personnel in emergencies and, to a lesser degree, general transport duties. When <em>ISAF</em> was wound down in January 2015, the contribution became part of NATO’s newly-created <em>Resolute Support Mission</em>. The Danish transport helicopter contribution was recalled at the end of September 2015.</p>"

This set out the framework for an international military force that would support the provisional government. The UN’s intent for this <em>International Security Assistance Force </em>(<em>ISAF</em>) was to put together a large scale force with a mandate in international law, that would be able to guarantee security in Kabul and its surrounding area while Afghan military and police forces were being built.</p>\n<p><em>ISAF</em> command would initially rotate every six months among the nations that were participating on a voluntary basis.

Teams 1-4 were deployed to difficult and violent operations throughout the province.<br />The first two teams were, respectively, comprised of the First and Second Light Reconnaissance Squadrons of the Bornholm Reconnaissance Battalion, each numbering approx. 250 soldiers. In Helmand, the Danes would provide security and stability in the area so that reconstruction and development work could commence. From Team 2, Denmark also provided CIMIC officers, ARTHUR radars and a National Support Group for the Helmand mission. Other contributions were made by staff personnel, military police, munitions clearance, Jaeger Corps forces and a logistics company, including engineering and communications detachments.<br />CIMIC stands for “civil-military co-operation”, which aims to strengthen collaborations between the deployed forces and local civilian authorities. The task of the CIMIC projects was not to rebuild Afghanistan, but to create conditions that were conducive towards allowing this to happen, by generating good will among the population and security in the region.</p>\n<p>ARTHUR (Artillery Hunting Radar) was an artillery beam radar that was used to register launch and impact points of incoming missile and mortar attacks. ARTHUR was initially based at Kandahar Air Field but would later be relocate to Camp Bastion in Helmand. ARTHUR has also been deployed to FOB Robinson, Price, Barakhzai, Budwan and Arty Hill. The radar was deployed from June 2006 to 11 February 2010, when it was recalled and taken out of service as part of a general phasing out of Danish Defence materials.<span>  </span></p>\n<p>Team 3’s contribution in Helmand mainly consisted of a scout squadron from the Jutland Dragoon Regiment. Team 4 would contribute a mechanised infantry company from the Danish Royal Lifeguards. With a mandate from the Danish Parliament, Team 4 would gradually be upscaled to battalion size. The Danish contingent (DANCON 4) had two rates of increase, initially involving the Scouts squadron from the Hussar Guards Regiment in August 2007, which contributed approx. 400 soldiers to Helmand. Later, in October 2007, the contribution was increased to approx. 550 men, a force that would grow to 700 soldiers over time.</p>\n<p>In November 2007, Team 4 was the first team to be assigned a troop of tanks, in the form of three Leopard 2 A5 tanks from the Jutland Dragoon Regiment. These turned out to be highly effective against their opponents, demanding their respect because of their superior firepower and observation capabilities.</p>\n<p>The Danish contingent from Team 5 (February 2008) was responsible for a fixed area of operations in Nahr-E Saraj. The scout squadron from Team 5 was replaced by another mechanised infantry company, using Danish Defence’s PMV M/113 G3 armoured personnel carriers. During this period, because of ISAF’s superior firepower, The Taliban would increase the intensity of asymmetrical warfare in the form of suicide bombs and improvised explosive devices.</p>\n<p>Team 8’s mechanised infantry company would be replaced by a light reconnaissance squadron (August 2009). Team 9 (February 2010) was the first time that the new CV9035 infantry combat vehicle (ICV) would be deployed. The new ICVs were armed with 35mm auto-cannon, which meant a significant increase to the company’s firepower. The increased armour provided by the vehicle provided crews with better protection. Because the Taliban considered the ICVs to be actual tanks, they also commanded respect.</p>\n<p>From Team 10 (August 2010), security in the Danish area of responsibility (Nahr-e Saraj and the capital, Gereshk) began to be at a level where Afghan security forces and police could take over certain duties from <em>ISAF</em>.<span>  </span>The training of local police and army forces was therefore given priority. The military security operations continued but would increasingly be performed with collaboration from Afghan Kandak battalions.</p>\n<p>Team 12 (August 2011) was the last Danish combat group to have its own area of operations. From Team 13 (February 2012), half of the Danish troops were deployed to train Afghan security forces. After this point, the gradual withdrawal of Danish troops and the return to Denmark of materials would commence, as capacity and organisational missions began to be prioritised over combat operations. Team 17 left the province on 1 August 2014 and would thus be the final Danish <em>ISAF</em> contingent in Helmand.</p>\n<p><em>Task Force 7</em>, comprised of soldiers from the Jaeger Corps and Frogmen Corps was deployed to Helmand from February 2012. In addition to its special forces, Task Force 7 also included interpreters, a doctor, an engineering officer and civilian and military police, a total of approx. 50 Danish soldiers who would mentor and train a special Afghan police unit. Training would not only be provided in combat, but in staffing and administration so that the police unit would be able to operate within the boundaries of Afghanistan’s own legislation. <em>Task Force 7</em> operated until February 2014.</p>\n<p>Denmark assumed command of the field hospital in Camp Bastion, Helmand, on 20 July 2009. This was the first time that Denmark had been at the forefront of a field hospital in a war zone. 97 Danish doctors and nurses took part alongside 45 Britons and 43 Americans, treating <em>ISAF</em> soldiers and Afghans. The contribution was recalled in October 2009.</p>\n<p>In 2008, the Danish Home Guard contributed a platoon of approximately 30 soldiers to the Helmand province mission. Platoons would be deployed multiple times until 2014, their main task being to assist in guard duties at the Danish camps. The main mission was at MOB Price, but periodically involved guard duties at forward bases like Armadillo and Bridzar. In 2013 the Danish Home Guard also contributed three agricultural experts to Helmand, where they would advise Afghan farmers in how to increase their agricultural yields.</p>"

Helmand was already known to be a Taliban stronghold, where rebel groups had broad support among the local population. This made the province one of the most unstable and dangerous regions of the country. Already with the deployment of Team 1 there was tough fighting between Danish troops and the Taliban. This combat was intense and at a level at which Danish forces had not fought since 1864.<br />In 2014 NATO’s <em>International Security Assistance Force </em>was shut down when Afghan security forces assumed responsibility for security throughout Afghanistan. A new smaller-scale NATO mission was set up in its place in 2015, called <em>Resolute Support Mission. </em>Its purpose was to continue the training and provision of advice to the Afghan security forces and national institutions. The new mission assisted the Afghans as they fought to defeat Taliban rebels etc. but did not playd an active role in the engagements. </p>\n<p>At its peak, <em>ISAF</em> numbered over 130.000 troops from 51 NATO and partner states and was therefore one of the biggest coalitions in world history and the most extensive NATO mission to date.</p>"

The contribution numbered about 50 personnel.<br />This contribution was initially assigned to the Kabul Multinational Brigade under German command. Command of this brigade was assigned to NATO in 2003.<br />The main duties of the first Danish contingent in Kabul (DANCON Team 1) were mine clearing (it was estimated in 2002 that approx. 11 million mines had been buried in Afghanistan as a result of 30 years of warfare). The contribution was part of a German-Dutch-Austrian-Danish battle group.<br />From (and including) DANCON Team 2, the Danish troops were assigned to a broader range of duties. These included advising Afghan troops through liaison officers. They also worked in the coordinating missions between <em>ISAF</em> forces and local police.The Danish military police unit that was assigned to the Multi-national Military Police in the Kabul Multinational Brigade, assisted in the investigation of accidents, crimes and performed patrol duties.<br />For periods of two months at a time, Denmark provided surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses to the field hospital at Camp Warehouse in Kabul, under German command.<br />The Danish Deployable Communications Module (DCM) was deployed with between 10 and 50 personnel at a time, for three month periods from 2004 until <em>ISAF </em>was wound down in 2014. The DCM company is part of a multi-national signals battalion within NATO’s permanent structure and was set up in 2003 (under its NATO name DCM E). The deployment to Afghanistan was the first time the DCM contribution had been deployed to set up and maintained links between NATO headquarters in Afghanistan and Europe. The DCM company was initially centred around <em>ISAF</em> HQ in Kabul. As <em>ISAF </em>operations were expanded, the military IT experts were also deployed to airfields in Kandahar and to other NATO installations in Afghanistan.<br />A total of nine teams were deployed to Kabul until the end of 2006. Denmark continued to be represented in the town in the form of a signals and communications unit at<em> ISAF</em> headquarters, a Danish staff contingent at the<em> ISAF</em> Joint Commands headquarters and at the NATO Training Mission, a smaller number of soldiers to operate Kabul’s international airport (deployed once airport command was reassigned from Germany to NATO in 2004) and a team whose duties included informing local populations about <em>ISAF</em>’s mission.</p>\n<p>A National Support Element (NSE) was assigned to Camp Viking in Kabul. Its mission was to manage and redistribute supplies from Denmark. NSE was stationed in Kabul until 2006, after which it was transferred to Kandahar Airfield and then to Camp Bastion in Helmand. NSE moved back to Kabul in 2014.<br />When the Danish mission in Helmand province was completed in August 2014, Danish focus returned once again to Kabul. Here, the main role of the Danish troops was to support Afghan security forces. The force provided by Denmark numbered 60 soldiers from the army, the main component being comprised of mentor contributions to the Afghan National Officers’ School and to higher-level Afghan military training institutions.<span> <br /></span>The army also provided staff officers, whose role was to plan, support and contribute to the development of Afghan security forces. The contribution from the First Bornholm Light Reconnaissance Squadron was also deployed to Kabul as a Movement Support Team. Lastly, a smaller intelligence unit was deployed, performing duties such as threat scenario analysis to assist the deployed troops. When <em>ISAF</em> was wound down in January 2015, the 2014 contribution became part of NATO’s newly-created <em>Resolute Support Mission</em>.</p>\n<p>Danish Emergency Management Agency personnel and units were also deployed to Kabul. This was partly because the <em>UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA</em>) required support setting up a coordination centre in Afghanistan – and partly because hospital capacity needed to be created, as existing capacity in Afghanistan was very low. The hospital was ready to admit its first patients in Kabul on 15 August, after being set up very quickly during the summer of 2013. It was equipped as a general hospital with a surgical ward, maternity wing, medical unit, casualty department and medical centre. A total of 71,060 patients were treated over the eight months it was in service. Most patients were admitted to the medical centre with minor injuries and ordinary complaints, and for vaccination (64%). Operations were required for 9% of those injured.</p>\n<p><span>The hospital deployment was financed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark and the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) and included contributions from Greater Copenhagen Emergency Services and the Danish Emergency Management Agency.</span></p>\n<p> </p>"

This set out the framework for an international military force that would support the provisional government. The UN’s intent for this <em>International Security Assistance Force </em>(<em>ISAF</em>) was to put together a large scale force with a mandate in international law, that would be able to guarantee security in Kabul and its surrounding area while Afghan military and police forces were being built.<br /><em>ISAF</em> command would initially rotate every six months among the nations that were participating on a voluntary basis.

The fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania when passengers had subdued the hijackers. The plane was believed to be headed for the White House or another target in the capital city of Washington, D.C. These attacks took the lives of nearly 3,000 people and shook Americans and the international community.<br />The attacks were masterminded from bases in Afghanistan by the international terrorist organisation Al-Qaeda led by Osama bin Laden.<br />US President George W. Bush in short order declared an international war on terror. The goal of this war was to defeat Al-Qaeda and similar terrorist groups and to punish states that supported them or allowed them to operate in their territories – primarily Afghanistan, where the 9/11 attacks had been planned.<br />These events led to the launch of the international coalition <em>Operation Enduring Freedom Afghanistan</em>, led by the United States. Its goal was to overthrow the Taliban regime and fight the terrorist network Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan (this effort is often referred to as the War in Afghanistan).</p>"

These resolutions condemned the attack on the United States and recognised the right of self defence and collective self defence against terror attacks. As the Taliban regime turned out to be reluctant to undertake the task of eradicating the terrorist networks operating within Afghanistan, the United States and the international community acquired the right to battle the threat of terror.<br /><em>Operation Enduring Freedom </em>was thus launched on the basis of Article 51 in the UN Charter, which deals with the fundamental right of nations to defend themselves against armed attacks. The operation received overwhelming international support. The EU, China, Russia, and Pakistan were among the supporters. For the first time, NATO invoked Article 5 in the North Atlantic Treaty, the so-called “Musketeer Oath”. It states that an attack on one is an attack on all.  </p>"

These fighters were part of a joint Danish/Dutch/Norwegian F-16 contingent of 18 aircraft in total. The aircraft were stationed on a military air base operated by the US (unofficially named the Peter Ganci Air Base for an American fire fighter who lost his life in the terror attack in New York), situated beside the civilian Manas Airport near the capital Bishkek in northern Kyrgyzstan. In addition to the contribution of fighter jets and personnel, the air base held 1,500 personnel from Spain, South Korea, and the United States. In all 147 Danes worked here during this period.<br />This collaborative effort took place within the framework of the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF) that had been set up when the F-16s were purchased. The role of EPAF was to facilitate the allocation of tasks and functions across countries. On 1 April 2003, Norway withdrew its contribution, and Holland and Denmark continued to operate with a smaller number of fighter jets.<br />The Danish F-16s were mandated to carry out action against Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces in Afghanistan. The primary task for the Danish aircraft was to provide air support for coalition ground operations by way of armed patrols and direct use of weapons against enemy forces and cave complexes. Given that the distance between the mission area and the base in Kyrgyzstan was more than 1,000 km, the Danish aircraft needed aerial refueling several times during each mission. In total, the Danish F-16 fighter jets completed 743 sorties in 372 missions in the airspace over Afghanistan, representing approximately 4,350 hours in the air.<br />Denmark’s contribution of air transportation consisted of one C-130 Hercules transport plane, two air crews, one ground crew, support personnel, and an Air Movement Control Element to handle loading and unloading of the international transport planes.<br />The contribution was provided between February and October 2002 and consisted of approximately 75 personnel based at the Peter Ganci Air Base at Manas in Kyrgyzstan. The Danes worked with the Dutch and Norwegian contributions of C-130s.<br />The Danish Special Forces contribution was a unit made up of 108 personnel from all forces in the Danish Defence, but primarily from the Jaeger Corps and the Frogman Corps, organised structurally under the Jaeger Corps. This group was referred to as the <em>Task Group Ferret/Task Force K-BAR</em>. It received personnel support from the Army Air Corps, the Danish Defence Intelligence Service, the Logistic Regiment, and the Guard Hussar Regiment. <em>Task Group Ferret </em>had a mandate to participate in the full range of special operations throughout Afghanistan. The Danish Special Forces were under the operational control of US Central Command and under the tactical control of an American task force – initially Task Force K-BAR and later the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force Afghanistan.<br />The operational tasks of the Danish Special Forces included Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE), Special Reconnaissance (SR), High Value Target (HVT), and Forward Air Control (FAC). They were primarily deployed in the southern and southwestern parts of Afghanistan, often for long periods at a time under very difficult conditions as many civilians sympathised with the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. The climate presented a challenge in that members of the Danish Special Forces carried up to 60 or 70 kg (130-155 lbs) of equipment and a week’s worth of drinking water during periods when the temperature exceeded 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit).<br />Task Group Ferret was deployed from 9 January to 4 June 2002 without experiencing any losses.</p>\n<p> </p>"

                        "text": "<p><span>Darfur is a region about the size of Spain in Western Sudan. At the end of the 19th century, Darfur was an independent state. The region was occupied in 1916 by British and Egyptian forces and became part of Sudan. When Sudan declared independence in 1956, Darfur continued as part of Sudan.<br />The conflict in Sudan has been described as a religious conflict between Christian farmers and Muslim nomads. A large proportion of Darfur's population is Christian, but the region’s population is predominantly Muslim. Others had described the conflict as being about land rights, resources and oil. The conflict has mainly been between Sudan's central government and rebels who want greater independence. The war intensified slowly in the early 2000s. Various ethnic groups in Darfur thought they were being discriminated against by the Arabic régime in Khartoum. In 2003 the various ethnic groups formed an armed opposition called Darfur Liberation Front (DFL). DFL’s objective was to avenge what they considered to be military attacks on their villages.<br />DFL soon changed its name to the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLM) which initially had a lot of momentum. In April 2003 SLM occupied Al Fashir, the capital of Northern Darfur. Many government troops were killed, and large quantities of the army’s military hardware was destroyed.<br />The régime in Khartoum was already engaged in a war against rebel movements in South Sudan and recruited the paramilitary Janjaweed militia from Arabic-speaking herders and nomadic tribes.  The militia attacked towns and villages populated by SLM sympathisers. Thousands of people from the non-Arab population were killed during the spring of 2004 and over a million people fled Darfur. They lacked food, water and provisions and many people died as they tried to reach refugee camps in Chad. This was a de facto humanitarian disaster. Initiatives were launched by the international organisations and the USA, among others, set things in motion to negotiate peace and ceasefires, but the fighting continued.</span></p>\n<p><span>In 2004 the African Union (AU) was mandated by UN Resolution 1564 of 18 September 2004 to move a peacekeeping military force (<em>African Union Mission in Sudan – AMIS I and II</em>) into Darfur. By the end of 2005, this force was 7,000 strong and operated until 31 December 2007, when it was replaced by a UN peacekeeping force (UNAMID).<br />The European Union decided to support AMIS, deploying a mission of civilian, military and police personnel who would advise, support and train AU forces.</span></p>"

                        "text": "<p><span>Ukraine has had a troubled history. Prior to World War I, the country was divided between Russia and the Habsburg Monarchy. After World War I ended, the country was occupied on various occasions by the Red Army, becoming part of the Soviet Union in 1920 and badly affected by war, famine and ethnic cleansing. World War II also inflicted immense suffering and loss of life. Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declared independence in 1991, but it was unprepared for the structural implications. Repeatedly, political crises arose, and priority was given to the relationship with Russia or with the West depending on who was in power at any given time. Ukraine became a member of the European Council in 1995, but any development in the direction of democracy was hampered by a lack of supporting legislation and by frequent political crises.<br />The start of the new century saw the organisation of mass demonstrations against the then president, which led to an election being called in 2004. Viktor Yanukovych won the election by a slim margin in a runoff against his opponent Viktor Yushchenko. However, it was clear that this outcome had been achieved by electoral fraud. The opposition took to the streets in what became known as the Orange Revolution. As a result, the Supreme Court ordered a second runoff, which Yushchenko won by a clear majority.  Yushchenko steered the country toward the West and expressed an ambition that it should become a member of NATO and the EU. The relationship with Russia was fraught with tension. The population was not ready for entry into NATO and NATO had no particular desire for it to join, but NATO did indicate that Ukraine might at some future time become a member. At a summit between the EU and Ukraine in 2008, Ukraine was promised an association agreement but not EU membership proper.</span></p>\n<p><span>Ukraine and Russia continued to have a difficult relationship, partly due to disagreements over the Sevastopol facilities for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Russia pointed out that Ukraine would experience serious consequences should it become a member of NATO. In 2010, the Ukraine government decided not to seek membership in NATO. In 2012, Viktor Yanukovych decided not to enter into an association agreement that had almost been completed with the EU. That decision triggered extensive street protests, and the situation deteriorated in February 2004 with armed skirmishes and widespread unrest. The so-called Maidan II (named after a square in Kiev) revolution had erupted. A peace accord was negotiated with the help of the EU, but the protests continued, and President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia. An election was called. The opposition appeared to be the likely winner. Russia reacted quickly by annexing Crimea. In eastern Ukraine, fighting broke out between government forces and pro-Russian militias.<br />Petro Poroshenko won the election. He was inclined to collaborate with the West and to enter into a peace accord.<br />This was the situation in which the EU decided to offer an Advisory Mission to Ukraine.</span></p>"

During the Six Days War in 1967, Israel conquered the entire Sinai Peninsula and the Gaza Strip, the border became irrelevant.<br />Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty in 1979, in which the Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt and, after Israel withdrew from the Sinai in 1982, a buffer zone of 100 metres was set up between Gaza and Egypt. Border control was now a joint Israeli-Egyptian project. When the Fatah-dominated Palestinian National Authority was formed in 1994, it was granted control of the Gaza side of the border, together with Israeli authorities.<br />Israel withdrew from Gaza on 7 September 2005 and the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Sinai was closed as a result.<br />An agreement to reopen the border, known as the Agreement on Movement and Access (AMA), was concluded between Palestine and Israel on 15 November 2005. The agreement was facilitated by the USA and the EU. Conditions for reopening the border were set out in the “Agreed Principles for Rafah Crossing” appendix to the agreement and entailed monitoring of the border by the EU. </span></p>"

During the 19th Century, the country was split between Ethiopia which received the central Ogaden area, Great Britain which received British Somaliland in the North, Italy which received Italian Somaliland in the South and France which received French Somaliland (present-day Djibouti). During the Second World War, British Somaliland was occupied by Italian troops in 1940. By 1941-1942, the entire Somalian area had been conquered by the British, with the exception of Djibouti. Ethiopia’s land was returned at the end of the war. Italy was allowed to administrate the former Italian Somaliland for ten years, according to a UN mandate. British and Italian Somaliland were united and became independent in 1959. Meanwhile, there were many different political viewpoints in the new country and unrest became apparent, not least because of the clan-based factions. The president was murdered in 1969 and the military seized power in a coup d’état. The coup was led by Muhammad Siyaad Barre, who introduced a socialist single-party régime.  From1970, Somalia allied with the Soviet Union, until the Soviet Union sided with Ethiopia in the latter’s conflict with Somalia and the Ogaden region.<br />Barre was a brutal leader who suppressed large parts of the Somali population. The Somali military and secret police were responsible for extensive human rights violations. Several rebel factions were formed and various clans revolted. Barre was toppled from power and a fragile provisional government was formed. The capital city was divided between two different clans and civil war broke out in southern and central regions of Somalia. A drought hit the country in 1991 and it is estimated that approx. 350,000 Somalians perished in 1991 and 1992. The lack of security and conflicts between the clan militias hindered extensive emergency aid, with the UN withdrawing from the country at one point.<br />Unrest and conflict continued in Somalia and in 2000 the country had no central government. One rebel faction had assumed control of the bulk of north-western Somalia and declared the region independent as the Republic of Somaliland. This area has been peaceful since 1997. Other rebel factions took control of the north-western area, naming it the Somali Republic of Puntland. This part of the country has also been relatively peaceful. Puntland wants to see the reunification of Somalia, however. Central and southern regions of Somalia fell under the control of Islamic militias, after a long period of fighting. This led to intervention in the conflict by Ethiopia. Alongside Somalia’s provisional government, Ethiopian military forces were able to drive the Islamists out of the larger towns and the government was able to occupy the capital of Mogadishu. The Islamists were not defeated, however, and al-Shahib (a movement resembling the Taleban and al-Qaeda) took control of most of southern Somalia in 2008. A new president was sworn into office in 2009 and, with the support of the African Union Peacekeeping Force AMISOM, the Islamists were gradually pushed back. A new parliament was sworn in in 2012. Free nationwide elections that same year also saw the election of a new president.<br />Unrest and insecurity continue to be a problem in Somalia. Criminality was also flourishing.</span></p>\n<p><span>Since the mid-90s, pirates operating from Somalia had become a serious problem in large areas of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea. Piracy had developed into a very lucrative activity. International naval forces were deployed to combat piracy. Denmark was also represented in this deployment.<br />The UN has maintained a presence in Somalia since 1991 in the form of various peacekeeping missions, which have had no major impact on peace in the region. The UN has also deployed emergency and aid programmes. These contributions are still ongoing.<br />The EU has assisted towards building a regional naval capacity since 2012.</span></p>"

On 8 August 2008, Georgia initiated an invasion of South Ossetia. The Russian response came quickly, and Russian armed forces moved into South Ossetia. After a few days of fighting, Georgia withdrew from the area. Russia recognised South Ossetia and Abkhazia as independent republics at the end of August 2008.<br />With intervention from the EU, The Six-point Agreement was signed by Russia and Georgia on 12 August 2008.

The various Mujahadin factions occupied different geographical areas, which led to internal power struggles between the many factions and commanders. It was therefore not possible for the central government to establish a representative form of government. The period leading up to 1996 was characterised by anarchy and administrative breakdown.  Approximately 1/3 of Kabul lay in ruins. Thousands of civilians had been killed and hundreds of thousands of people had taken flight.<br />The Taliban movement appeared in 1994. Its goal was to bring the civil wars to an end, and to conquer the entire country. This took place in September 1996, when the movement occupied Kabul, with the exception of areas in northern and central Afghanistan. The Taliban were initially welcomed by the population, as they brought peace and physical security with them. This would change, as the movement began to intensify its moves towards an islamification of the country. Women were not permitted to leave their homes unveiled or unaccompanied by a male member of their family. Schools for girls were closed. Men were not permitted to trim their beards etc. The movement was also responsible for the massacre of civilian populations and ethnic religious minorities.</span></p>\n<p><span>In January 2001 the UN Security Council condemned the Taliban régime as a centre of international terrorism, including Osama bin Laden who the USA suspected of being behind terrorist attacks on American targets. Responsibility for the attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington was attributed to bin Laden’s al-Queda organisation and the USA and United Kingdom carried out extensive bombing attacks against the Taliban régime and Al-Qaeda. Comprehensive military aid was channelled to the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, who had been resisting the Taliban for several years. The Taliban gave up their final stronghold in Kandahar on 7 December 2001.<br />UN Security Council resolution 1368 of 12 September 2001 was generally interpreted as a mandate for military actions in response to the 11 September attacks.<br />The basis for a provisional government was established at a meeting in Bonn in December 2001. Extensive international economic and military aid was contributed and the international community provided extensive advisory support towards rebuilding the country.</span></p>\n<p><span>NATO assumed command and responsibility for the international peacekeeping forces in August 2003.

Ten days of fighting ensued in Slovenia, but the extent would not have lasting impact on the Balkan nations In Croatia, the Serbian minority opposed independence from Yugoslavia and also opposed inclusion of Serbs in a Croatian state. Fighting erupted between Croats and those Serbs living in the border area between Croatia and Bosnia. The Yugoslavian army actively supported the Serbs in this war. The European Community undertook several initiatives to end the fighting, but to no avail. In parallel, the UN in 1991 arranged for the introduction of a number of restrictions on transport of arms and ammunition to Yugoslavia. At the same time, discussions took place regarding a potential UN mission with the aim of reaching an initial ceasefire. In getting involved in the Balkans, the international community made extensive use of police personnel to inform and report on humanitarian aspects and provide surveillance, monitoring, and training. Some of these were provided by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE/OSCE). Danes took part in these activities. The task was challenging due to the many conflicts between various population groups and the resulting violent confrontations. During the 1990s and 2000s, Danish police personnel were sent via OSCE to all of the Balkan Peninsula. This report focuses on Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Albania.</p>"

These protests complained about the dictatorial government and the so-called pyramid investment schemes being foisted on the people. Many lost their money, and a popular uprising began. With the looting of arms depots, it developed into a civil war. The opposition asked OSCE to intervene. In March, the government requested military assistance as it had lost control of large parts of Albania. The mandate was adjusted over time to suit the situation and the evolving events in Albania. It has been extended several times. <br />One year after the adoption of Resolution 1101, another OSCE mandate was established. This one had to do with <strong>Croatia</strong>. OSCE set up a Police Monitoring Group in the Croatian Danube region. The mandate was created by Permanent Council Decision No. 239 of 25 June 1998. This mandate was intended to take over the missions that had been initiated three years earlier. A peace agreement pertaining to Eastern Slavonia had been entered into on 12 November 1995 between the Croatian government and Serbian negotiators. The agreement was entitled ”Basic agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja, and Western Sirmium”. One of the stipulations in the agreement was that the UN set up an administrative apparatus to govern the region in a transition period. As the upshot of all this, the OSCE Police Monitoring Group mission assumed what had originally been the remit of the UN operation UNTAES. By Permanent Council Decision No. 373 of 21 September 2000, it was the plan that the OSCE Police Monitoring Group would cease activities as an independent unit in the Danube region as of 31 October 2000.<br />In<strong> Macedonia</strong>, an OSCE mandate with support from the Danish Police was established by OSCE Permanent Council Decision No. 439 of 28 September 2001 on request from the Macedonian government. The mandate was based on the goals stated in the “Ohrid Agreement”. The intent of the agreement was to put an official end to the armed conflict between the National Liberation Army and Macedonia’s military and police forces. One of the goals of the mandate was to assist in and ensure a phased and coordinated transformation and installation of the local Macedonian police and to develop policing related projects in various police districts. It has been extended several times.<br />A few years after the OSCE provided support to Macedonia, the organisation became involved in conflicts between <strong>Serbia and Montenegro</strong>. When Montenegro became an independent nation in 2006, OSCE established, by Permanent Council Decision No. 732 of 29 June 2006, a separate mission exclusively focusing on the challenges experienced by Montenegro as a sovereign country. With respect to police work, the areas in which OSCE were to assist were in particular training and development, professional responsibility and internal controls, organised crime control, forensic medicine, border police activities, and local police activities. The mandate was extended several times and ended upon its expiry in December 2018.</p>"

                        "text": "<p><span>The Troubled History of Ukraine Prior to World War I, the country was divided between Russia and the Habsburg Monarchy. After the war, the country was occupied several times by the Red Army, and as of 1920, Ukraine became a part of the Soviet Bloc. In the Soviet era, the country was beset by war, famine, and ethnic cleansing. Also World War II, inflicted immense suffering and loss of life. Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declared independence in 1991, but it was unprepared for the structural implications. Repeatedly, political crises arose, and priority was given to the relationship with Russia or with the West depending on who was in power at any given time. Ukraine became a member of the European Council in 1995, but any development in the direction of democracy was hampered by a lack of supporting legislation and by frequent political crises.<br />In the years after 2000, mass demonstrations were staged in protest against the then president. In the 2004 election, Viktor Yanukovych won by a slim margin in a runoff against his opponent Viktor Yushchenko. However, it was clear that this outcome had been achieved by election fraud. The opposition took to the streets in what became known as the Orange Revolution. As a result, the Supreme Court ordered a second runoff, and Yushchenko won it by a clear majority. Yushchenko steered the country toward the West and expressed an ambition to have it become a member of NATO and the EU. The relationship with Russia was fraught with tension. The population was not ready for entry into NATO, and NATO had no particular desire for the entry – but indicated that Ukraine might at some future time become a member. At a summit between the EU and Ukraine in 2008, Ukraine was promised an association agreement but not membership proper.<br />Ukraine and Russia continued to have a difficult relationship, partly due to disagreements over the Sevastopol facilities for the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Russia pointed out that Ukraine would experience serious consequences should it become a member of NATO. In 2010, the Ukraine government decided not to seek membership in NATO. In 2012, the president decided not to enter into an almost completed association agreement with the EU. That decision triggered extensive street protests, and the situation deteriorated in February 2004 with armed skirmishes and widespread unrest. The so-called Maidan II revolution had erupted (it is named for the Maidan Square in Kiev). With the help of the EU, a peace accord was negotiated, but the protests continued, and President Viktor Yanukovych fled to Russia. An election was called. The opposition appeared to be the likely winner. Russia reacted quickly by annexing Crimea. In eastern Ukraine, fighting broke out between government forces and pro-Russian militias.<br />Petro Poroshenko won the election. He was inclined to collaborate with the West and to enter into a peace accord.<br />OSCE then decided to deploy an observer mission to Ukraine.</span></p>"

Right leaning and left leaning governments alternated, with moderate right leaning United National Party and left leaning Sri Lanka Freedom Party, respectively, in power most of the time. But there were simmering ethnic and religious tensions all along. Nationalism in Sri Lanka was very much based on the culture of the Sinhalese Buddhist majority, and over time, political leaders have increasingly adopted a nationalist platform to the detriment of Sri Lankan and Indian Hindu Tamils. In 1948, Tamils of Indian descent had their civil rights revoked, and efforts were made to send them back to India. The ethnic tensions flared up in the 1970s with the emergence of the Tamil freedom movement <em>Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam</em> (LTTE) and the eruption of frequent anti-Tamil riots, the most violent ones taking place in 1983. A bloody civil war ensued, plaguing the country ever since. The Indian government for a time attempted to perform mediation and in 1987-1990 deployed troops on the island. Nationalist policies were evident in the new official name of the state, in constitutional reforms that departed from the British model, and in nationalisation of private interests. During the 1990s, the economy saw growth as a result of reforms and more liberal policies.<br />A constitutional reform was to provide greater autonomy for Tamil regions, but it was shelved for the time being in 2001. A ceasefire agreement was brokered by Norwegian officials in 2002, but the parties did not adhere to it. Since 2006, clashes between government forces and LTTE have erupted to include attacks close to the civilian airport and attacks on tourist destinations. The army mounted an offensive against LTTE bases in eastern Sri Lanka as of 2007. A minister was killed in 2008 by a roadside bomb, and the government then formally withdrew from the ceasefire agreement. The Sri Lanka army managed, after heavy battles, to conquer LTTE in 2009 and to kill the leaders of the movement. It is estimated that close to 70,000 people were killed during the civil war.</span></p>"

The black population was oppressed in terms of political rights and economic opportunities. The white nationalist Reunited National Party came to power in 1948, introducing a strict racial discrimination policy known as apartheid.<br />Black political organisations such as the African National Congress (ANC) were declared illegal by the white regime in 1960, and the struggle against the white regime became more violent. Due to its policy of apartheid, South Africa was increasingly shunned by the international community. Therefore, negotiations were initiated in 1989 between the white regime and the ANC.<br />The leader of ANC, Nelson Mandela, had been in prison since 1962 and was released in 1990. Apartheid was officially abolished that year. In the first democratic election in 1994, ANC gained control of the parliament, and Nelson Mandela became president.<br />Danish Police has participated in several smaller missions in South Africa.</p>"

The black population was oppressed in terms of political rights and economic opportunities. The white nationalist Reunited National Party came to power in 1948, introducing a strict racial discrimination policy known as apartheid.<br />Black political organisations such as the African National Congress (ANC) were declared illegal by the white regime in 1960, and the struggle against the white regime became more violent. Due to its policy of apartheid, South Africa was increasingly shunned by the international community. Therefore, negotiations were initiated in 1989 between the white regime and the ANC.<br />The leader of ANC, Nelson Mandela, had been in prison since 1962 and was released in 1990. Apartheid was officially abolished that year. In the first democratic election in 1994, ANC gained control of the parliament, and Nelson Mandela became president.</p>"

One of the instruments used to assist the new government was the UN mission The United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI). This mission was set up in 2003 by the UN Security Council on request from the Iraqi government. The purpose of the mission was to support and improve the democratic systems in Iraq and to help coordinate humanitarian initiatives from the UN and other organisations working in Iraq. UNAMI is active in Iraq to this day.<br /><em>The United Nations Development Program (UNDP)</em> was approved in the UN General Assembly on 22 November 1965 and executed as of 1 January 1966.

They settled on the eastern part of the island while French pirates gradually settled on the western part. In 1697, the western part officially became a French colony by the name of Saint-Domingue. France operated sugar and cotton plantations by the use of slave labour, and at the end of the 1700s, African slaves made up 90% of the population. After the French Revolution in 1789, an insurrection by slaves broke out, and France lost its dominion over the area. British and Spanish troops now invaded, and slavery was abolished in 1794.<br />The British were expelled in 1798 by in an insurrection led by an African who also took control of the Spanish part of the island, Santo Domingo.  France again attempted to take control of the island, but in 1804, the western part of the island declared independence under the name Haiti. Now came tumultuous times of rebellions, revolutions, counter-revolutions, and battles between blacks and people of mixed race. The Spanish part of the island declared independence in 1843 under the name The Dominican Republic. The United States invaded Haiti in 1915 to restore stability. This occupation lasted until 1934. The U.S. retained considerable influence in the country through its connection with the mixed-race population. A powerful black nationalist movement arose in reaction and brought François Duvalier, Papa Doc, to power in 1957. He set himself up as dictator and president for life. He was succeeded in 1971 by his son Jean-Claude Duvalier, known as Baby Doc. He was overthrown in 1986 as a result of a massive popular uprising. It took until 1990 for free elections to be held. Jean-Bertrand Aristide came to power. He was ousted in 1991 in a coup led by General Raoul Cédras. Strong international pressure brought about negotiations under the auspices of the UN between Cédras and Aristide. American troops were deployed, and the negotiations resulted in Aristide returning from exile to resume his presidency. In the 1995 presidential election, a candidate supported by Aristide won. Aristide could not run in this election due to provisions in the constitution.</span></p>\n<p><span>The agreement between Cédras and Aristide was named the Governors Island Agreement of 3 July 1993 after the island in New York Harbor where it was signed. </span></p>"

Nothing came of the Arab Palestine state that had been planned, and more than 700,000 Palestinians became refugees as a result of the war and were housed in refugee camps in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria.</p>\n<p>A nationalist Palestinian movement emerged during the 1950s. Financial assets left behind by Palestinian refugees in Israel were nationalised in the early 1950s, and the remaining Palestinians were under surveillance although they became Israeli citizens with full political rights. The Palestine Liberation Organization, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization\">PLO</a>, was established in 1964 on the instigation of the Arab League. As of 1968, the Palestinians took control of the organisation. During the 1970s, PLO was recognised by the Arab world and most of the Third World as the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, and through the 1980s, the organisation achieved a certain level of recognition in Europe. The U.S. refused to recognise PLO, and the Israeli view was that it was a terrorist organisation with which negotiations could not be undertaken. As a result of the impact of the Palestinian uprising, the Intifada, in 1987 and <span>the Gulf War</span> in 1991, a group of Palestinians and Israelis negotiating in Oslo reached an agreement in which the to parties recognised each other as legitimate representatives of the Palestinian and Israeli people and committed to the creation of a future Palestinian state made up of Gaza and the West Bank. These areas are now the Palestinian National Authority.</p>\n<p>On 10 September 1993, Israel and PLO formally acknowledged each other. PLO acknowledged Israel’s right to exist as a nation, and Israel acknowledged PLO as the representative of the Palestinian people.<br />On 13 September 1993, the Oslo agreement was signed in Washington by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat with U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei V. Kozyrev in attendance.<br />In March, the UN appointed a Special Coordinator for the peace process in the Middle East.</p>"

The conflict was rooted in fundamental disagreements as to the implementation of the constitution of newly independent Cyprus. These disagreements included the diametrically opposed national aspirations of the two groups.<br />The situation in Cyprus was dire. The UK, former colonial ruler of the island, therefore called the parties to the negotiating table. Here, it was decided to create a neutral zone by withdrawing Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot units to a ceasefire line in Nicosia referred to as the ”<em>Green Line</em>” (it had been drawn on the map with a green pen).<br />Still, the hostility between the two population groups was deep, complicating the British effort at conflict resolution. An international solution was called for. This solution was found on 4 March 1964 in the form of a UN-organised peacekeeping mission named <em>United Nations Force in Cyprus</em> <em>(UNFICYP)</em>.<br />Nevertheless, the mission was unable to contain the ethnic tensions on the island while at the same time, Greece and Turkey actively resisted a solution to the conflict.</p>\n<p>On 15 July 1974, with support from Greece, Greek Cypriot resistance group EOKA B and parts of the Greek Cypriot National Guard carried out a coup against the Cyprus government.<span>  </span>Turkey viewed this coup as an attempt at annexation on the part of the military junta in Athens. In response, Turkey on 20 July 1974 initiated an invasion of the northern part of Cyprus.<br />The Greek Cypriot National Guard immediately mobilised a battle-ready army of almost 40,000 men, and fighting broke out in and around the many enclaves on both sides of the Green Line. The peacekeeping UN forces were caught in the middle without a mandate to do anything about the military action.<br />After just under a month of heavy fighting, the Turkish force had conquered and now controlled about 40% of Cyprus. The invasion sent nearly 160,000 Greek Cypriots fleeing toward the southern part of Cyprus. Many of them had been forcibly evicted by the invading Turkish forces. Conversely, many Turkish Cypriots left their homes in the Greek area.<br />With Turkey’s military gains, the parties entered into a ceasefire on 16 August 1974. The demilitarised zone controlled by <em>UNFICYP</em>, known as the <em>Green Line, </em>was expanded to cover the area between the two fronts across the entire island (referred to as the <em>status quo</em>). This line is still a de facto border between Northern and Southern Cyprus.</p>"

The mission could use armed force only in self defence.<br />Upon Turkey’s invasion into Cyprus in June 1974, the UN Security Council issued Resolution 353 as a follow-up. In it, the Security Council demanded that all foreign powers immediately withdraw their military forces from Cyprus. In addition, the Security Council called for peace negotiations between Greece, Turkey, and the UK. The Turkish invasion led to several other resolutions that condemned the unilateral invasion of Cyprus and expressed concern about the fate of the many refugees.<br />As of August 1974, <em>UNFICYP </em>was tasked with monitoring the recent ceasefire between the two parties and with assisting in the maintenance of <em>status quo</em>.</p>"

As a result, <em>UNFICYP </em>was reduced in size; DANCON now numbered 300. At the same time, a reorganisation of the overall UN force took place. DANCON assumed responsibility for the Lefka District, a mountainous area in the northwestern part of the island. In the area were several larger Turkish enclaves and smaller Turkish villages.<br />Upon the Turkish invasion in August 1974, the total manpower of <em>UNFICYP</em> was increased from about 2,300 to about 4,400. The Danish contingent, DANCON, was increased from 220 to 430 men in the course of a few days. Now, the maintenance of status quo was performed by constant surveillance and patrolling in the demilitarised buffer zone.<br />Since 1975, the number of shooting incidents and advances between Turkish and Greek Cypriots has been decreasing significantly. Therefore, <em>UNFICYP</em> and DANCON were cut in size in 1976.<br />From 1990 to 1992, the Chief of Staff position was held by a Danish brigadier general. A Danish staff officer worked at UNFICYP from 1993 to 1994.

Initially, Denmark contributed DANCIVPOL, a police contingent of 40. The Danish police contingent was recalled in 1975 after having served for over ten years. This peacekeeping police mission was the first one in which Denmark supplied nearly 500 personnel.</p>"

Turkey approved the declaration of independence the same day. The UN Security Council responded by issuing Resolutions 541 and 550 in which it stated that the declaration was illegal and requested that no other sovereign states recognise the Turkish-Cypriot declaration of independence.<br />Without success, several attempts on the part of the EU and the UN to solve the conflict have been made since the Turkish invasion in 1974.

However, there have been changes on the island since 2003 when border crossings between Northern and Southern Cyprus were opened for the first time since 1974.<br />The <em>UNFICYP</em> mission has not succeeded in resolving the underlying ethnic tensions driving the conflict.

The agreement applies to persons crossing land borders between states that have signed the Schengen Agreement, as well as at airports and ports in participating countries. Denmark signed the Schengen Convention in 1996 and has, in practice, taken part in the partnership since 26 March 2001.<br />In counterpoint to the free movement of people between participating countries, border controls have been tightened at the external borders of the Schengen countries.<br />The Schengen Convention includes various agreements about policing and legal partnerships on criminality, the fight against narcotics and setting up the Schengen Information System (SIS), which grants member states access to information about certain categories of people and objects.</p>"

                        "text": "<p>The USA and Iran have had no formal diplomatic relations since the Iranian Revolution of 1979. <br />The relationship between the two countries has been largely based on conflict, and has been characterised by mutual hostility and economic sanctions. In 2003, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that Iran possessed the prerequisite capabilities for the enrichment of uranium. This prompted the United States to accuse Iran of developing a nuclear weapons program, which is a violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to which Iran is a party.<br />The UN Security Council ordered Iran to stop enriching uranium, which it refused to do, claiming that the enriched uranium was for peaceful use in their nuclear reactors. Nevertheless, the Security Council implemented extensive international sanctions against Iran in 2006, the EU following suit later on. These sanctions had major consequences for the Iranian economy. In 2015, the US, China, Russia, France and the United Kingdom (within the UN Security Council), as well as Germany and the EU, managed to negotiate a long-term nuclear deal with Iran. According to the terms of this deal, Iran would destroy its medium-grade enriched uranium, 98% of their low-grade enriched uranium and, over a 13 year period, 2/3 of the centrifuges used for uranium enrichment. In return, US, UN and EU sanctions were lifted.</p>\n<p>When Donald Trump was elected as president of the United States, there was a shift in the USA’s policy on Iran. Even before the election, Trump had criticised the nuclear deal, calling it a bad deal. The USA protested that Iran would be able to build an atomic bomb within 12 months, before the end of the agreement. Trump tried initially to negotiate a new deal, but this failed. Therefore, in May 2018, the USA chose to withdraw from the nuclear deal, and US sanctions were thus resumed. At the same time, Trump threatened to sanction European states and companies that continued to trade with Iran. This meant that the sanctions against Iran were now an international reality.<br />In May-June 2019, Iran was accused of deliberately disrupting commercial shipping after several tankers were sabotaged in the Gulf of Oman. Iran shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz on June 20, further escalating the situation. On July 4, British Royal Marines attacked an Iranian oil tanker, Grace 1, near Gibraltar on suspicion that the ship was carrying crude oil to Syria in violation of EU sanctions. On July 19, following threats and an earlier failed attempt, Iran successfully confiscated a British-registered oil tanker, Steno Impero, as it sailed through the Strait of Hormuz. This strait links the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman and is extremely important for global oil exports. <br />To secure international shipping traffic in the area, the USA created the multinational International Maritime Security Construct (IMSC) mission, with participation by the United Kingdom, Albania, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. A European mission led by France was also launched to complement the US-led efforts in the area. <br /><em>European Maritime Awareness In the Strait of Hormuz (EMASoH)</em> was created on 20 February by nine European countries (France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Finland, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal and Denmark).</p>"

The EMASoH mission’s area of operations is the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz and the Arabian Sea.<br />The Danish contribution will thus have the right to use force in self-defence, as well as to defend other EMASoH and IMSC military units (based on the principle of collective self-defence). Because international law does not grant states the right to acts of self-defence on behalf of commercial ships, EMASoH will only be mandated to assist such vessels if the attack comes from a non-state actor (such as pirates or paramilitary units with no insignia).<br />Since it is considered to be highly unlikely that Iran would use its own military troops with insignia to sabotage tankers, a construction under international law of this nature will also be sufficient to provide security for commercial shipping traffic in the area.</p>"

Iran's aggression towards commercial shipping during May-June 2019 has led to a further escalation of the conflict between the two sides.<br />Two proxy attacks against US positions in Iraq were conducted at the end of December 2019. Here, Iranian-backed militias carried out a rocket attack on an Iraqi base that housed personnel deployed as part of Operation Inherent Resolve. The attack wounded several members of the Iraqi security forces, four American soldiers, and killed one American citizen. A few days later, the US embassy in Baghdad was attacked by Iranian-backed militias.<br />The USA responded on January 3, 2020, when Major General Qassem Soleimani, of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, was assassinated in an American drone attack on the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. Soleimani was a powerful political and military figure in Iran and the broader Middle East, and was considered the architect of Iran's activist policy in the region, for example by providing support to various militias and terrorist organisations in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, the Lebanon and Afghanistan. <br />The killing of Soleimani was a significant escalation of the conflict. In a revenge attack on January 8, 2020, Iran fired several ballistic missiles at the Al Asad Airbase in Iraq. The attack wounded 120 American soldiers. 130 Danish soldiers were also present at the base as part of the Operation Inherent Resolve training mission. The Danish soldiers were subsequently evacuated to Kuwait until the situation was back under control.<br />It was in the immediate aftermath of the rocket attack that Iran accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane, killing all 176 people on board.</p>\n<p>The situation has de-escalated slightly since the tense crisis in January 2020, . American positions in Iraq were, however, regularly attacked by Iranian-backed militias between February and March 2020.<br />As long as Iran and the USA have opposing interests in the region, the relationship between the two countries will be one that is based on conflict. This has been so since the Iranian Revolution of 1979.</p>"

It is a voluntary pool of resources which the EU countries have already earmarked for immediate deployment in or outside the EU. One of its elements is the European medical corps. This is a pool of doctors and public health experts that can be quickly deployed to emergency or intervention operations. A centre called “the European Emergency Coordination Centre” <em>(ERCC)</em> has been set up to coordinate the activities and is the civil protection mechanism’s operational core: It is open around the clock and coordinates the EU's disaster response.</p>\n<p>The Council decided to amend the EU civil protection mechanism on 7 March 2019. The aim of the new rules was to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>create a complementary pool of resources for situations where overall existing capacities are insufficient,</li>\n<li>strengthen the existing voluntary pool of national capacities,</li>\n<li>improve risk prevention by obligating member states to further develop their assessment of their risk management capacity and risk management planning and</li>\n<li>promote education and knowledge sharing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On 8 February 2020, the Council reached a provisional agreement with the European Parliament on a proposal to strengthen measures. The new rules include a total of €1,263 million in funding for 2021-2027 and up to €2,056 million to implement civil protection measures as defined in the EU recovery instrument to address the effects of the COVID-19 crisis.</p>\n<p>In a joint declaration by the members of the European Council of 26 March 2020 and in the resolution of the European Parliament of 17 April 2020 on a coordinated EU action to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences, the Commission was encouraged to propose a more ambitious and comprehensive crisis management system in the Union.</p>"

Danish-operated ships were attacked by pirates in these waters during both 2020 and 2021.<br />In 2020, about 40% of all globally reported incidents of piracy took place in the Gulf of Guinea, the vast majority of these off the Nigerian coast, with a smaller number off Ghana, Togo, Benin, Cameroon and Gabon. Furthermore, almost 95% of all maritime abductions in 2020 took place in the Gulf of Guinea. Simultaneous to this, pirates seem to be increasingly willing to attack all types and sizes of trading and fishing vessels, including large container ships at distances as far away as 200 nautical miles from the coast. <br /></span><span>Denmark has had a close collaboration and ongoing dialogue about maritime security with, notably, Nigeria, Ghana and several regional collaborative forums, including the regional security architecture – Yaoundé Code of Conduct, which brings together 25 West African coastal states.

In 2019, the World Health Organisation, WHO, announced the possible outbreak in China of a form of pneumonia, the cause of which was unknown. The outbreak was related to a fish market in the city of Wuhan. Just six days later, China saw the first recorded death from Covid-19. Information about the new “corona” virus was then published, and the progress of the disease quickly began to accelerate. There were positive Covid-19 tests in Germany, France and Italy before the first Dane tested positive on 26 February.<br />Respiratory infection in humans caused by the Corona virus had, however, already been reported in 1966, which was followed up by a detailed description the following year. It was already known by 1968 that respiratory infection from the Corona virus was more frequent during the winter, and that children were less prone to becoming seriously infected. It also became apparent that people were already familiar with the virus in the 1930s but did not understand its extent and potential for contagion.<br /></span><span>It therefore did not take long after the outbreak in China for the rate of infection to spread rapidly. It then became a pandemic, which was particularly virulent in certain communities and countries. Very many countries were entirely unprepared for the pandemic, with healthcare systems that found the increased workload difficult to cope with, some even being unable to cope with the task and do anything whatsoever to help their populations. The development of vaccines gained momentum; the first vaccines becoming ready by the end of 2020, which meant that the process of vaccination could begin.<br /></span>All affected nations did the best that they could with their existing healthcare systems and stockpiles of protective equipment, masks and hospital equipment. A number of countries found themselves having to recognise, however, that they needed external support in terms of both materials and healthcare personnel.<br /><span>It is estimated that approx. 60% of the world's population was affected to some extent by the Covid-19 Corona virus; and that approximately six million people or more have died of the disease. </span></p>"

Both countries had requested support via the EU.<br /><span>Following a taskforce recommendation in May 2021, the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Danish Ministry of Defence and the Danish Ministry of Health approved requests (via the EU) from North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Iraq and Nepal for the donation of protective equipment and medical equipment.</span></p>"

The aim here is to demonstrate the solidarity of the countries that form the NATO alliance and to highlight the willingness to protect NATO's population and territory against any form of aggression.</span></p>\n<p><span>The Danish Parliament (in its decision B127 of 24 February 2022) adopted the stance that Denmark would make certain military contributions available to NATO's collective defence. The Danish Government wants Denmark to be able to make further contributions at short notice to NATO’s collective defence, with a view to reinforcing its Eastern allies and ensure NATO's profile of deterrence.</span></p>"

It also involved Denmark’s ongoing contribution to NATO headquarters and NATO-operated units, including staff and liaison officers and a new Danish contribution to NATO’s combined air forces. Finally, Danish fighter planes could be deployed to enforce sovereignty in the airspace over the territory of the NATO countries. In connection with the rotation, establishment and recall of the contributions, it may be necessary to deploy up to approximately 200 people on a temporary basis.</span></p>\n<p><span>The frigate contribution would be either a <em>Iver Huitfeldt</em> or <em>Absalon</em> class vessel, including a helicopter and a total crew of up to approx. 150 personnel. The frigate <em>Niels Juel</em> sailed on 27 February 2022 from Naval Station Korsør to join NATO's naval <em>Task Group 441.01</em>. This is part of NATO's <em>Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF)</em>.<br />The transport aircraft contribution would be a C-130J transport aircraft with air and ground crew of approx. 50 personnel. Depending on the location, it would also be possible to deploy a national logistical support element and a national communications unit with up to approx. 30 personnel. Additional to these would be a drone surveillance system (AGS), which can perform land and maritime surveillance in support of NATO operations, and a communication unit of up to approx. 70 personnel. </span></p>\n<p><span>The Danish contribution to the enforcement of sovereignty in the airspace over the territory of the NATO countries would consist of up to 20 F-16 combat aircraft with up to approx. 250 air and ground crew. It would be possible to transfer personnel and material for NATO's enforcement of sovereignty in the airspace over Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania as part of NATO's integrated air defence, as adopted in Danish Parliament decision B210 of 2 June 2004.</span></p>\n<p><span>The right to deploy the units to perform missions would be delegated to SACEUR in accordance with established command and control.

Denmark’s current contribution (2024) to the CMF is staff officers for the coalition’s headquarters in Bahrain, as set out in B 56 of 9 February 2017. The CMF is divided into a number of task forces, including CMF Task Force 153, which covers the Red Sea.</span></p>"

Significant material donations from various EU countries arrived as the war went on, which unfortunately sometimes suffer from a lack of quality control and strategic coordination.

In 2014, the Ukrainian government decided to suspend its neutral status and seek a closer relationship with Western partners, including NATO. In light of the ongoing civil war in eastern Ukraine, then President Petro Poroshenko asked NATO to provide more support to the effort of reforming the defence and security sectors in the country to bring them into compliance with NATO standards.
